SATIRA VI. 362—418.

Non esb, ud video, non est, quod agatur apud VOS,
Haec de comoedis te consulit 3 illa tragoedum 396
Commendare volet: varicosus fiet haruspex.

Sed cantet potius, quam totam pervolet] urbem

Ipsa loqui recta facie strictisque mamillis.
Haec eadem novit, quid toto fiat in orbe3
Quid Seres, quid Thraces agant: secreta novercae
Et pueri: quis amet, quis decipiatur adulter.
Instantem regi Armenio Parthoque cometen

Afferte! atque illis dominum jubet ante feriri,

397. varicosus] scil. with stand-
ing so long.

400. paludatis ducibus] “Generals
with the ‘ paludamentum ' 011.” This

by a special ‘lex’ on each occasion
of a general assuming his command:
i. e. he then became ‘imperatum‘
He assumed the ‘ paludamentum ' as
he quitted the city, and laid it asido
on his return. lt thus resembled

river.

415. Effer-ata] “ullhousdt . . . .“”’

418-432.] “Some day, when
her husband has a dinncr-party, the
