avoid exciting Nero's jealousy)‚ tanto
plns famae adeptus.'' The two latter
difficulties seem wholly unexplained.
lt would dispose of all three if Ju-
venal's cotemporary was a son of
Rubellius Plautus, bearing the same
name as his grandfather Blandus.
But there is no authority for this;
and “te ” in 1. 42 must then mean,
“ him through whom you claim,'' i.e.
‘⁶ your father.''

41. nobilis] In its strict sense,
‘⁴ well-born.” The idea is thus am-
plified in 1. 42, 43, the construction
of which is in apposition with “no-
bilis esses,'' i.e. depending on ⁸⁴ fece-
ris ’³ in 1. 41.

42. quae-Iuli] i. e. Julia. See
note on 1. 39. 40.

43. non quae—texit] “ and not
one of the hired weavers on the
‘ agger.’ ’' A household of repnte al-
ways had its own loom, worked by
the slaves. It was only those of mean
condition who were obliged to '‘ put
out ’' the weaving, the pay for which
was probably trifling enough. There
were no manufacturing houses. as
with us, except sor the more costly
fabrics For ‘· agger,'' see note on

Sat. v. 153.

46. Cecropides] ‘⁴ Athenian‚'' i. e.
an αὐτόχθων, like the Athenians,—
“ one of the aboriginal families.'’
See Lidd. and Scott’s Gr. Lex„ αὺ-
τόχθων.

49. de plebe toy] “from this city

population.” See note on Sat. iii.

52. aquilas] i.e. the legions. See
note ou Sat. ii. 101.

53. trunco—Hermae] the Ἑρμαῖ
were the first rude conception of an
image ;—a square stone, shaped at the
top into a. bust,and therefore without
hands Ol· feet. This is of course the
meaning here. The first images of
this kind were probably those of
Hermes (Mercu1·y); but the name
was retained even when the pedestal
was surniounted by the busts of other
deities.

56. Teucrorum] Rubellius, as be-
longing to the Julia gens, was in di-
rect descent from Iulus (Ascanius).
See Virg. Aen. i. 288, Julius, a
magno demissum nomen I'dlo.'’
