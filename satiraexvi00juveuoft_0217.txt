dog's mistress. This, however, is an
oversight of the poet. Bubastis (the
Egyptian Artemis) had a temple in
the city of the same name. See
Herod. ii. 137, Βουβάστι πόλι . . .
ἐν τῇ καὶ ἱρόν ἐστι Βούβαστιος
ἀξιαπηγητότατον.

9 porrum—morsu] This prohi-
bition was confined to Pelusium.
See Aul. Gellius, xx. 8, ⁸‘ Eam cau—
sam esse dicant sacerdotes Aegyptii,
cur Pelusiotae caepe non edunt: quia
solum olerum omnium contra lunae
aucta atque damna vices minuendi
et augendi habeat contrarias.”

ll. lanatis animalibus] See He-
rod. ii. 4'2‚‘¹Oo·ot μὲν δὴ . . . νομοῦ
τυῦ Θηβαίου εἰσὶ, οὗτοι μέν νυν
goim-ss· ὀΐων ἀπεχόμενοι, αἶγας

υθυσῑ.

12. fictum—capellae] See Herod.
ii. 46, σέβονται δὲ πάντας τοὺς
αἶγας οἱ Μενὸήσιοι. For ‘⁶ fetum,''
see on Sat. xiv. 78.

14. tale—facinus] i. e. the canni—
balism of Antiphates and Polyphe-
mus (1.18). See note on Sat. xiv.
20. The wanderings of Ulys 5565 were
detailed by himself to his entertainer
Α16111οἴι5 king of the Phaeacians,
they occupy Od. vi —xiii.

16 αζείαίοριιε]“ braggart;'' from
λε”γειν ἀρετάς, i. e. his own.

17. Charybdi] See it described
Od. xii. 235—243, ἑτέρωθι δὲ fita
Χάρυβδις Δεινὸν α’νερῤοἱβὸησε θα-
λάσσης ἁλμυρὸν ὕδωρ. The mode

in which Ulysses escapes is detailed
l. 430-444. It suggested (or anti-

Poe

19. Scyllam] Described Od. xii.
85-100. 245—259. She has six
necks: δειραὶ περιμήκεες· ἐν δὲ
ἑκάστῃ Σμερὸαλέη κεφαλὴ, έν δὲ
τρίστοιχοι ὀδόντες. Her abode is
a cave immediately opposite to Cha-
rybdis. To avoid the whirlpool, the
ships are compelled to keep 011
Scylla's side: as they pass her ca-
vern the necks emerge, and pick off
six of the creW.

19, 20. concurrentia sclav, Cyaneas]
sub. Συμπληγάδας. These were two
rocks at the entrance of the Bos-
porus, which closed as ships passed.
See their description 111 Od. xii. 59—
62, where they are called Πλαγκταὶ
from their being possessed of mo-
tion The ‘Argo' passed safely
through them, after which the rock
became fixed, and therefore ceased
to be a source of peril. Cf. Eurip.
Med. 2, Εἶθ’ ὤφελ’ Ἀργους μὴ
διαπτάσθαι σκάφος, Κόλχων ἐς
αἶαν, κυανέας Συμπληγάδας.

20. plenos-utres] Those given
by Aeolus to [15 sses, with the cou-
trary winds tied up in them. The
sailors opened them, supposing thev

contained treasure. See Od Χ. l?
