Si flectas oculos majora ad. crimina.

plifies the “ majore-funera ” of the
two preceding lines. “ Under this
calaxnity a man does not merely
counterfeit grief, satisfying himself,
as in the conventional mourning of
funerals, with a slight disorder of
dress (lit. content to throw open
the top of his dress), and a sti-aincd
tear or two. The tears are quite
genuine on this occasion.''

132. vestem diducere summam]
Th1s was an usual expression of
grief See Seneca, Troades, Act. i.
87-89. Its object was to allow of
the mourner beating his breast. See
Sen. l. c. ⁴¹ veste remissa substringe
sinus, uteroque tenus Pateant artus.''
So l. 103-106, “ cadat ex humeris
vestis apel-tis‚imumque tegat Suffulta
latus3 J am nuda vocant Pectora
dextras.'’

136-139] “ If, when a bond
(‘tabellis') has been read before
witnesses ten times over in various
places, people allege that the signa-
ture of the worthless document is
forged, when their own handwriting
confutes them as well as the first-
water stone of sardonyx, which is
guarded in their own ivory casket.''
The “ sardonychus ” (for the more
usual ‘ sardonyx ¹) is the seal used for

the hond. Being in the debtor's
own custody‚ no impression of it
could have been purloined. The
bond referred to here was an ‘⁶ obli-
gatio literis‚'' which required the
admission of the debtor, either in
writing or before witnesses, to give
it complete validity. In the present
case the creditor has the admission
in boch kinds. That before witnesses
is referred to in l. 136, and that under
thegebtor's hand and scal in l. 137

136, 137. tabellis-ligni] i. e. the
wooden tamem, covered with wax,
on which legal documenta as well
as othegs3 were written. See note on
Sat. i. .

137. vana] Lit. “false ;'' a fre-
quent sense of the word. Here it
means “forged.'' See translation
above. For a construction similar
to that of this line, see Sat. xiv. 165,
166, and note.

140. delicias] sub. “hominis.''
See vi. 47 and note.

141. yallz'nae filius albae] Apro-
verb for ‘⁶ fortune's favourite‚'' the
colour white being fortunate. See
Sat. xii. 65. The origin of the pro-
verb is unknown.
