PREFACE.

THE present notes were completed without reference to
any other English edition, but the compiler has since re-
ferred to Mr. Macleane’s larger work (in the Bibliotheca
Classica), and made some useful additions from it. In
some instances he has been unable to adopt Mr.Ma01eane's
view ; and the latter has hardly done justice to the Freneh
commentator (Achaintre).

The size of the present work obviously excludes notes
of criticism or illustration, merely as such ; neither has it
allowed much discussion of conflicting renderingS. For
the purposes of eaplanation it is hoped that it will be
found reasonably exhaustive3 and that the student will
be able to feel that he has mastered the author's text and
train of thought, as well as the coll-atera] matters arising
in his perusal. It should be observed, that no verbal
explanation is given which may be obtained directly from
the dictionary.
