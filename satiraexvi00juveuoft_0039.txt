SATIRA ΙΙΙ. 117—155.

Numinis Idaei: procedat vel Numa, vel qui
Servavit trepidam flagranti ex aede Minervam :
Protenus ad censum, de moribus ultima fiet 140
Quaestio. Quot pascit servos? quot possidet agri
J ugera? quam multa magnaque paropside coenat Ῥ
Quantum quisque sua nummorum servat in arca,
Tantum habet et fidei. ‚J ures licet et Samothracum
Et nostrorum aras : contemnere fulmina pauper
Creditur atque deos, dis ignoscentibus ipsis. 146
Quid, quod materiam praebet causasque jocorum

 

Omnibus hic idem, si foeda et scissa lacerna,
Si toga sordidula est, et rupta calceus alter

Pelle patet 3 vel si consuto vulnere crassum

150

Atque recens linum ostendit non una cicatrix.
Nil habet infelix paupertas durius in se,

Quam quod ridiculos homines facit. Exeat, inquit,
Si pudor est, et de pulvino surgat equestri,
Cujus res legi non sufficit, et sedeant hic 155
