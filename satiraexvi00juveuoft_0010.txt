The writing was usually confined to
one side ofthe parchment or papyrus,
which was then rolled up, and put
away in a case: hence ‘evolvere
librum' is to read it. In the present
case the poem, after filling up the
proper unu-grin, had then (lonc the
sime with the blank space on top of
the roll, and its margin, and finally
overflowed on to the back.

ἶ. lucus Alartis] Perhaps that
of Alba, where Romulus and Remus
were born. But it is of course un-
certain.

8, 9. antrum Vulcani] i. c. Hiera;
one of the ‘'Aeolian isles‚'’ ΝΕ.
of Sicily. “ Aeoliis vicinum rupi-
bus;'' i. e. adjacent to Lipara, the
abode of Aeolus. which thus gave
name to the uhole group. So in
virgil, Aen. viii. 416. 417, Vulcan's
workshop is described by reference
to Lipn·a; ‘⁶ Insula Sicanium juxta
latus Aeoliamque Erigitur Liparen,
fumantibus a1·duasaxis.'' In Homer.
the workshop is in Olympus. and the
position of the isle of Aeolus uude-
termiucd.

9. Quiri ayant venti] Perhaps sug-
gested by the “Aeoliis rupibus ''
above.

ib. tora ucat]

10, 1. statii-(ze — pelliculae]
‘⁶ Bears away the gold of the stolen
fleece ;” i. e. steals and bears away.
In Pindar, Pyth. iv. 430, the fleece
is taken with the knowledge of
Aeetes ς-ἕννεπεν, ἔνθα νιν ἐκτάνυ-
σαν Φρὶξου μάχαιραι. It was
⁴nuarded by a dragon. See note on
Sat. xiv. 112-114.

ll. quantus—vrum] i. e. the bat-
tle of the Centaurs and Lapiths.

“ tort111·es.”

Monychus was a Centaur leader.

12, 13. Frontonis—columae] The
owners of large houses lent them for
recitations (see Sat. vii. 40), which
would usually, for coolness, take
place in the garden of the house.
Hence ‘platani,' l. 12, the. plane being
the favourite ornamental tree of the
Romans. See Hor. Od. ii. 15, 4, 5,
“platanusque coelebs Evincet ul-
mos.'' ''‘ Marmora '' and ‘² columnae''
are the marble panelling and pillars
of the saloon (⁸ oecus ³), which opened
by folding doors into the gartlcn.
These ‘ oeci ¹ were one of the reflue-
ments of later times. In the earlier
Roman houses the only sitting-room
was the ‘atrium·,'--an apartment
in the centre of the house, commu—
nicating with the garden by a passage.
Fronto is probably M. Cornelius
Fronto; a successful advocate and
teacner of rhetoric in the reign of
Hadrian. He purchased the gar-den
laid ont by Maecenas on the Esqui-
line hill. See Hor. Sat. i. 8. 7,
‘⁵ vetatque novis considere in hor-
tis;” cf. l. 14, 15.

ib. concussa—ruptae] i. e. by
the recitation (“ lectore '³ for ‘⁶ lec-
tione'') itselfz—of course ⁴by a
strong hyperbole. The applause of
the auditory, which is the explana-
tion sometimes given, (cf. Sat. vii.
860 can hardly be meant here, as it
would involve a strained construc-
tion of the “assiduo lectore‚'' and
still more of the “ clamant ¹⁸ in l.
12. For ‘ ruptae' cf. Virg. Georg-
iii. 328, “cantu querulae rumpent
arblusta cicadao;'' and see Macleane
ad oc.
