Qualia perpetuus Phaeacum auetumnus habebat ;
Credere quae possis subrepta sororibus Afris.

Tu scabie frueris mali, quod in aggere rodib,

Qui tegitur parma eb galea, metuensque flagelli

Discit ab hirsu‘ca jaculum torquere capella.
Forsitan impensae Virronem parcere credas.—

Hoc agila, ub doleas ε
Quis melior plorante gula}>

Cogaris‚ pressoque diu stridere molari.

Tu ‘cibi liber homo eb regis conviva videris.
Captum te nidore suae putab ille culinae:

Nec male conjectab. Quis enim ‘cam nudus, utillum
Bis ferat, Ebruscum puero si contigit aurum,
Vel nodus tantum, eb signum de paupere loro? 165

‘agger' was probably that of Ser-
vius Tullius. lt had long ceased to
be of use as a fortifivation, and was
the favourite resort of the poorer
classes ;—a kind of low “ boule-

passage, Juvenal mentions the ple—

and the women who wove for hire

version, by which 11. 154, 155, mean
“a reci-uit‚'' ‘capella' being taken
as a cant term for a drill-master.
The apple then will be such as the
recruit gnaws, not the monkey. The

chief support of this is the Scholiast's
statement that the Praetorian guard
was quartered near 11115 “ἱιςὲ81·.”
Τ1115 is probably correct enough.
But the ‘ ‹·apella‚' for a driu-master,
