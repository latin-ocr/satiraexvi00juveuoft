JUVENALIS

Pullabi proceres, differt vadimonia Praetor. .
Tunc gemimus casus Urbis, tunc odimus ignem.
Ardet adhuc, eb jam occurrit, qui marmora donet,
Conferat impensas. Hic nuda et, candida signa, 216
Hic aliquid praeclarum Euphranoris eb Polycleti,
Hic Asianorum vetera ornamenta Deorum,

Hic libros dabit et forulos mediamque Minervam,
Hie modium argenti. Meliora ac plura reponit: 220
Persicus, orborum lautissimus, et merito jam
Suspectus, tamquam ipse suas incenderit aedes.
Si potes avelli Circensibus, optima Sorae,

212, 213] ‘⁴ You have the niatrons
dishevelled, the great men in black,
the courts closed ς ” i. e. it is treated
as a public calamity. See on Sat. xv.
135. ‘ Est' and ‘sunt' are under-
stood after ‘ mater ' and ‘ proceres ς’
and ‘ mater ’ is used for ⁶ mat1·es,' i. e.
‘ m:·t1·onae.'

213. deff? vad. Praetor] i. e. the
courts are closed. The technical
phrase (which constantly occurs in
Livy) was “justitium (jas, stare) in-
dicitur.'' lt was the first measure in
any public danger or calamity.

ib. vadimonia] The praetor did
not himself 8712( causes; lie only sent
them to be tried hy the judices. The
procoedings before the praetor con-
sisted of two distinct parts. First
the ‘ffl'tlQ' or right of trial, was
granted ·, in other words, it was de-
cided that “ the action would lie.''
On a second (lay, usually the next
hutone, the plaintiff made hisfornial
claim. If simply denied. the cause
was at issue* and a ‘judex' at oin-e
appointed. Frequently however the
defendant tendered a plea (⁸ exceptio')
in reply. In this case the ‘judex'
was not appointed till the plea was
disnosed of.

On both days the personal atten-
dauce of the parties was required.
The defendant's first attendance
could bc conwclled by ἴοι-ους and
he was not disvbarced until he had
given a surety (vas) for his atten-
dance on thc second day. lf the
‘⁸ vas '⁹ was satisfactory, the plaiutiff

accepted it, aud was theu said
‘⁴ vadari reum;''—“ to let him go on
surety.” The defendant, on his part,
was said “ vadimonium facerc'' (or
‘⁴ promittere ”). then he discharged
the surety by his own appearance un
the second day, the phrase was “ va-
dimonium sistere-'¹

“Dgfferre vadimonium'' (thephrase
in the text) was to postpone the day
sor the defendant's second appear-
ance. This might be done by ar-
rangement, or by the courts being
closed on any particular day. The
effert of this latter was that all the
‘⁶ vadimonia” due that day ‘⁵ stood
over ” till the next sitting. The surety
in these civil causes was ‘⁸ vas ς ''—
“ praes'' was the “ bail '³ in criminal
cases.

alrea‹ly.''

216. impensas] sub. “ pecunias.''
Costs of rehuilding.

219. mmlz‘am] In tho centre of
the case. There is another rendering,
by which “mediam'' is taken for
“dimidiam;”—a bust of Minerva.
But this is a most rare use of the
word, and it seems unnecessary to
resort to it here.

223. Circensibus] i. e. the Circen-
ses (ludi) ς so called from the Circus
Maximus, in which they were cele-
brated. See note on l. 653 also on
