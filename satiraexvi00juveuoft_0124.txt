lius Lentulus. He took the agnomen
of Gaetulicus from liis victory over
the Gaetuli in Africa, ΑΛ). G.

27. Silanus] Cognomen of the
Julia gens.

⁶29. populus] scil. of Egypt.

⁵29, 30. Osiri invento] i. e. on the
birth of “ an Apis‚'' who was sup-
posed to be the soul of Osiris. 'she
public rejoicintgs on this occasion are
described by Herodotus, iii. 27, 23.
The exclamation is said to have
been εὑρήκαμεν συγχαίρωμευ. The
meaning of the lines is, ‘⁴ So rare is
the union of merit with high birth,
thatwe mightcryn‘tpvjrmpsv over it,''

32—38] “ Nicknames„ I need not
tell yon„ often go by oppositos. We
call a man's dwarf Atlas, and so on.
Take care that somebody does not
call you a great man.'' Dwarfs were
kept in rich families as a source of
amusement.

33. pravam] “mis-shapen.'' ¹‘ Ex-
tortam‚'' lit. ⁴⁴ dislocated ;'' i. e. all

tion between the two epithets.

his conquest of Crete, B.C. 67.

ib. Camerinus] This was a cog-
nomen of the Sulpicia gens.

39. his] ‘⁴ In all this.''

39, 40. Rubelli Blande] There are
three difficulties in this passage.
1. The Rubellii were connected with
Ncro through Julia, (“quae sanguine
fulget Ii‘ili‚'' 1. 42) the daughter of
Drusus, and granddaughter of Tibe-
rius. But Rubellius Blandus was her
husband5 her son (see l. 42, “ ut te
conciperet'') was Rubellius Plau·
tus. 2. Assaming the above dif-
ficulty disposed of by substitut-
ing “Plaute'' for “Blande'⁷ in
l. 40, a second arises on the chro-
nology of the passage. Rubellius
(Plautus) was banished‚ and even-
tually murdered by Nero, who was
jealous of him as his probable suc-
cessor. This was A.D. 623 while Ju-
venal was probably born ΑΒ. 54,
only eight years before. And yet
Juvenal is clearly speaking of a co·—
temporary (see ‘⁴ vivas,'' l. 46), and
that a young man. 3. The arrogance
here ascribed to Rubellius is quite
inconsistent with his character in
Tacitus, Ann. xiv. 22, “ Habitu se-
vero, casta et secreta domo, quau-

Blande. Tumes alto Drusorum sanguine, bamquanssz„
