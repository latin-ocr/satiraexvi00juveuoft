Τι’. Pegasus] An eminentjnrist
made ‘praefectus urbi ⁵ by Donmian.
'she ‘praefectus urbi ' was the · cus-
tos urbis' of the regal period and
early republic 3—the king's (and
afterwards the consul's) substizute,
for the discharge of their functions,
within the city, when absent. When
the ‘ praetor urbanus ' (third consul)
was instituted, his office, uhirh was
identical with that of the ‘custos

u1·bis,' absorbed the latter. Its sha-
ἵ dow, however, was still retained un-
i der the title of ‘praefectus urbi,' and
for the purpose only‘of celebrating
the F eriae Latinae.' Under the
empire, the ‘praefectus urbi' again
recovered the functions of the an-
cient ‘custos‚' the office of ‘ praetor

urbanus’ being absorbed into itin
turn.

and bad as the times were, he was
fain to acquiesce in the disarming of
Justice3 i. e. in the submission of
law and constitutional right to the
ruler's will. 'she statue or Justice
had always a swerl iu one hand.
