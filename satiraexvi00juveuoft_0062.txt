ib. capillato consule] “ years ag0.”
Lit. ‘when a Consul still wore his
hair long.' This was the case till
B.c. 300, when the contrary practice
was introduced 3 -— simultaneously
with that of shaving. See note on
Sat. iv. 103.

The “bellum sociale '³ broke out
B.C. 90, and was terminatcd in the
following year by Pompeius Strabo.
It was a revolt of the allied states
(“socii'') of Italy, with the excep-
tion only of the Latius, Tuscans,
and Umbrians. The revolt was pro-
voked by the jealousy of the “ socii ”
at their continued exclusion, as a
body, from the Roman citizenship.
On the termination of the war, this
point was judiciously conceded: see
note on Sat. iii. 34. The Italian
states having thus become an integral
part of the eommonwealth, the term
“ socii '⁸ was now transferred to allied
states out of Italy.

It should be observed that the
complete term for the Italian allied
states had been “ socii Latini‚'' (or
‘nomen Latinum‚') i. e. “socii et
Latini ;'' the inhabitants of Latium
having, from their early connexion
with Rome, the privilege of being
thus distinguished from the “ socii''
ofthe rest of Italy. See Sat. viii.

3⁴. Setinis] From Setia in the
Pomptine marshes. Under the em—
pire, its wines to some extent super·
seded those of Campania.

36, 37.] “Wine fit only for a
festival.'' The particular festival
instanced is remarkable as showing
J uvenal's attachment to republican
institutions. It is one which he sup-
poses Thrasea and Helvidius to have
kept on the birthdays of the “ libera-
tors of their country;''—the Bruti
(the two ‘⁶ patriota ” of that name),
and Cassius. Thrasea (P. Thrasea
Poetus), and Helvidius (Priscus Hel-
vidius, the son-in-law of Thrasea),
were both famous for the indepen-
dence they professed under the em—
pire. The former was murdered by
Nero ΑΛ). 66. The latter, after being
banished by Nero, and recalled by
Galba, was again banished by Ves-
pasian (whom he refused to recognize
gs emgeror) and finally executed by

ιε or er.
