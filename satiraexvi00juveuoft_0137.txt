234] i. e. as if you had been de-
scendants of the Gauls who sacked
Rome. Properly ‘ Gallia. Braccata'

’ was identical with ‘Narbonensis‚'

the south-east district of Gaul. The
term therefore is not strictly accu-
rate here, as the tribes who migrated
into Italy came from the centre and
north-east of Gaul. See Amold¹s
Hist. Rome, i. 516. But the term is
loosely used here for ‘Gallorum ³ in
general, so as to include ‘ Senonum?
‘⁴ Children of the Gaul, descendants
of the Senones themselves.” The
latter were probably the tribe who
actually took Rome⁷ the other tribes
who had immigrated with them re-
maining in Northern Italy.

235. tunica—molesta] i. e. as in-
cendiaries. See note on Sat. i. 155-
157. Cf. Mart. Ep. x. 25. 5, “ cum
dicatur tunica praesente molesta U re
manum.''

236. Consul] i. e. Cicero. See note
on l. 232, 233.

’ 237. Arpinas] Cicero was bom
at Arpinum, a town of the Volsci.
ib. novus-iynobilis] Because he
was the first of the family who filled
a curule office. Those whose an-
cestors had done this were the ·‘ no-
biles ;” those who first filled it them-
selves were ‘⁵ novi homines.'' Cf.
notes on Sat. i. 1002 v. 110.
“ ib. et—Eques] Cicero's family was
of the equestriau order at Alpinum,
and therefore, as Arpinum had ac-
quired the complete Roman ‘ civi-
tas‚' at Rome also. His status,
however, 'm the latter would of course

Sed Roma. parentem,

only be that of a “ municipalis (pro-

vincial) eques '' See note on Sat. 111.
34, and Middleton's Life of Cicero,
p. 2, note 4, 5; p. 3,

ib. modo] ‘⁸ lately.”

239. praesidium adtonitis (sub.
“ civibus'')] a guard over them.
“ Adtonitis,'' ⁴· stupor-struck.'' Cf.
Sat. iv, 77. 146.

ib. 2'72 omni pente] See Cic. Cat
2. 12 ad init.‚ “Coloni omnes mu*
nicipesque vestri, certiores a me facti
de hac nocturna excursione Cati-
linae, facile urbes suas finesque de-
fendent.’'

240. ‘muros intra toya (see on

xvi. 8)]. 'she conspimcy of Ca-
tiline was a ⁵ tumultus ³ only, not a
‘ bellum.' Perhaps too the ‘² muros

int1·a” refers specially to the decree
of the senate that Cicero should re-
main to guard the city while Anto-
nius pursued the conspirators.

241. titulz] ·· monumental inscrip-
tions.'' Cf. Sat. vi. '230; x. 143,
144. Or perhaps it is the inscription
on the ‘imagines' as in Sat. i. 130:
v. llO. See note on the latter.

ib.] Leucade i. e. at Actium. The
island Leucas. on the Aeamanian
coast, is used for the Acarnanian
promontory Actium, off which the
battle between Antuny and Augustus
was fought. The latter lay to the
north-east of Leucas, at the entrance
of the Ambracius Sinus.

242. Thessaliae campis] The battle
of Philippi is meant. Philippi really
is in Thrace.
