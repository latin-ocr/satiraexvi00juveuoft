Quid, si vidisset Praetorem in curribus altis
Exsbantem, eb medii sublimen1[in]pulvere Circi,
In tunica J ovis, eb pictae Sarrana ferentem

Ex humeris aulaea bogae, magnaeque coronae
Tantum orbem, quanto cervix non sufficit ulla? 40
Quippe tenet sudans hanc publicus, et, sibi Consul
Ne placeatis, curru servus porba‘nur eodem.

Da nunc eb volucrem, sceptro quae surgi‘c eburno,

Illinc cornicines, hinc praecedentia longi
“Agminis offi—cia eb niveos ad frena Quirites,

Defossa in loculis quos sportula fecit amicos.

Occursus hominum, cujus prudentia monstrat,

35. praeteria — trabeae — lectica]
See notes on Sat. i. 783 viii. 2593
and i. 32.

ib. tribunal] The plaetor's seat
for administering justice. See note
on Sat. iii. 213. It was erected at
one end of the ‘basilicas or “law-
court.'' There were several of these
‘basilicae' in Rome, and their size
was considerable. On the establish-
ment of Chm'stianity the ‘ basilicae '
were mostly converted into churches,
the altar being placed where the
‘ tribunal ¹ previously stood.

36-46,] “What would he have
said if he had seen the praetor pre-
siding at the (Ἅι-0011511111 gam es?” See
note on Sat. iii. 2233 vii. 87. The
praetor rode in procession to the
Circus Maximus, and afterwards
presided at the chariot races. See
note on Sat. iii. 223. The descrip-
tion here (from “praecedentia,'' ]. 44)
seems to apply to the former part of
tbe ceremony, viz. tlae processioa.

In Sat. xi. 191-193 it is probably

” the raa-es at which the praetor is pre-

sidinu.

3ὃί.5 tunica Jovis] This was kept
in the Capitol, and used only on state
occasions.

ib. Sarrana] i.e. Tyrian⁴ ‘⁴ Sarra''
was the ancient name of Tyre.

39. wdaea wyae] ‘⁶ cur-tains of his

toga,’' which was probably of great
size. ‘· „aulaea” means usually the
‘ siparium ' 111 the theatre. See Sat.
viii. 186, and note. The term, how-
ever, is also used for hangings iu a
private house. They caused the acci-
dent at the ‹linne1·ofNasi‹lienus, Hor.
Sat. ii. ὃ, 54, ⁵* Interea suspensa graves
aulaea ruinas In patinam fece1·e.''

41. tenet] Above the praetor's head.

41, 42. publicus—sermm] Alarge
bod>- of slaves belonged to the state,
and were hence called “ publici ser-
vi;'' as ‘publicus ager* means the
state lands. They were employed in
the care of the public buildings, as
attendants on the magistrates (and
priests). executioners‚and jailors, and
in similar capacities. These ‘² pub-
lici servi '³ were better treated than
those who were in the hands of pri-
vate proprietors.

41. Consul] i.e. the praetor. The
ternis were originally identical.

45. niveos] with whitened togas.
So Hor. Sat. ii. 2. 60, “ natales,

ret.

46. sportula] See Sat. i. 95, and
noxe.

ib. defossa in loculis] “ interred
