-Otlzoni] The “ pulvinum eques-
txe³⁵ (lit. knight's cnshion) refers to
the regulation of the '⁸ quatuorderim
ordines ” at the theatre. The latter,
as regards the spectators' portion,
consisled of semicircular tiers of
benc-hes arrande oncabove the other
in front of the stage < pulpitum ³).
lt will be seen, thar from the semi-
c1rcular arrangement of the benches,
a considerable space would be left
between them and the stage. This
was termcd the ⁸ orchestra ς’ and, in
the Roman theam-e, was occupied
by the seats of the senate, foreign
ambassadors, and other persons of
distinction. In Β C. 68 a further ap-
propriatiun was made by the Lex
Roscia 'l'heatralis, passed by L. Ros-
cius Ollco. By this foui-teen rows of
the tiers of benrhes immediately ad-
joining the ‘orchestra' were cushioned
and reserved forthe ⁶ equestris ordo.'
see1.l59; aud cf. Hor. Epod. 4. 16:

“ Sedilibusque magnus in primis
eques
Othone contempto sedet.”

The ⁶ census equestris: or qualifica-
tion sor that '⁸ ordo,' was wuooo ses-
terces3 see note on Sat. v. 572 x. 94,
95. And cf. Hor. Ep. i. l. 58,

‘⁸ Si quadringentis sex septem millia

desunt
Plebs eris.''

Accordingly, it follows that ‘ sedere
quatuordecim ordinibus' is equiva-
lent to having this property; and so
Sat. xiv, 323, 324. It should be ob-
served that this semicircular arrange·
ment of the benches at the theatre

distinguished it from the amphi-
theatro, where they formed a com-
plete circle round the arena. See
note on Sat. ii. 147.

155. leyi] i. e. the law of Otho
above referred to.

158. cultos] “spruce.''

ib. lanistae] A trainer of gladia-
tors3 cf. Sat. xi. ὃ. They were
called his “familia,” and his esta-
blishment itself“ ludus.'' For ⁴ pin-
nirap1‚' see Dict.

161. sarcinulis] Lit. “bundles.''
It seems to have become acant term
for the ⁸ dos ’ brought by a vvife to
her husband. So that ‘impar ' vall be
‘⁸ unsuitable ;'' i. e. a bad match for.
This is quite intelligible, without
supposing any specifie obligation in
the husband to settle property equal
to the ‘dos ' of the young lady
(⁴ puellae ').

162. quando in consilio est Aedili-
bus] Under the republic there were
four aediles, two plebeian, who were
appointed atthe Mons Sacer, B.C. 494,
and two catule (patrician), appointed
Rc. 365. Their duties were nearly
identical. They were police magis-
trates. commissioners of the markets‚
public buildings, and state lands, and
directors of the festivals. Of the
latter, the ‘ludi magni' and ‘Me-
galesia‚' and the dramatic represen-
tations, were specially in charge of
the curule aediles, In B.c. 45, two
additional plebeian aediles were ap-
pointed. Under the empire, the
aediles were police magistrates only,
their other duties having been trans-
ferred to the ‘ ruratores? Hence,
in this passage, ⁴ Quando—aedilibus'
means, ‘· when is he (the poor man)
