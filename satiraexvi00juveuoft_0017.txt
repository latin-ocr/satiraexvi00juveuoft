SATIRA I. 89—109. 9

Nobiscum. Da praetori, da deinde tribuno!

jorum gentium‚” and the newly-
admitted patric-iaus became ‘² mino-
rum ’' in their tum, and the same
process was from time to time re-
peated. A still further change took
place under the later republic and
empire, when an aristocracy arose,
founded on mere personal desert.
At first, indeed, something of an
hereditary chamcter was given even
to this by the line drawn between
the “ nobiles ¹* aud “ novi homines ;''
see note on Sat. viii. 2373 but gra-
dually even this disappeared, and the
distinction became purely personal.
The new aristocracy thus created was
regarded by the old families with
great jealousy. As an expression
of it, they transferred to the recent
creatione the invidious term “mi-
norum gentium,” while they them-
selves nom asa body, appropriated the
name and traditions of the ‘⁴ maj orum
gentium.'' The latter of course in-
cluded their Trojan descent3 al-
though in strictness this only be-
longed to the Ramnes, who were in-
stituted by Romulus.

104. fenestrae] Holes pierced for
the earrings-a badge of servitude
in the East.

105. qui ue tabernae] See note
on Sat. vii. ” 20, 221.

106. qwdrinyema] Large amounts
were computed at Rome by sester-
tii, as in France now by francs.
The sestertius (“ semis tertius‚”
the “third a half;'' i. e. two <md
a half) was 2} of the denarius,
= *22³³ asses Its symbol is Hs. (or

Expectent ergo tribuni ;

11⁵3) i. e. two3 and S. for semis.
To expedite the computation,

(a) 1000 sestertii were called “ ses-
tertium '⁷ (perhaps not used in fact).

(b) ’2000 to 999‚000 were called
“duo sestertia,'' διας or, “duo δια,
millia (sub. ‘seste1·tiomm’); '⁹ or else
(as here ⁴⁸ quadi-aginta'') the nume-
ral was used alone3 (sub. ‘⁶ millia
seste1·tiorum.'')

(c) For 1‚000,000 and upwards,
the numeral adverbs were used, after
which “ centena millia sestertiomm''
is understood3 thus ''decies'' (centena
millia sest.):l,000‚000. To trans-
late these sums of decies and up-
wards rapidly, take off a cyphen and
add a milliong thus vicies, 20, and
taking off the ‘⁶ 0‚'' 2 million.
The word ‘ sestertium,' which is
sometimes written after the ‘⁵ millia,''
is always the eontracted genitive
plur. from sestertius. then writ-
ten in numerals, a stroke over the
numeral shows that it is the adverb,
and therefore ‘⁵ centena millia '' un-
derstood—Thus H.S.M. 1000 sester-
tii ; H.S.M. “ millies centena millia
sestertiorum,'' = 100,000,000 ses-
tertii.
