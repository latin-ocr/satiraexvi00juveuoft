Ad partes, monstrum nulla virtute redemtum

A vitiis, aeger, solaque libidine fortis.

Quid refert] igitur, quantis jumenta fatigeb 5
Porticibus? quanta nemorum veebetur in umbra ‘r'
Jugera quot vicina foro, quas emerit aedes?

Numa prescribed stoning only. It
is not known who was the Vestal
here referred to.

12. caderet sub] “be condemned
bv.’'
' ib. judice morum] Under the
republic, this was the censor's office.
ln making out the census, he ap-
pended a remark (nota censoria) to
the name osany citizen who had been
guilty of private οι· politica] miscou-
