SATIRA IV.

Pompeius tenui jugulos aperire susurro ;

93—127. 49

110

Et, qui vulturibus servabat viscera Dacis,
Fuscus, marmorea meditatus proelia villa;

Et cum mortifero prudens Veiento Catullo,

Qui numquam visae flagrabat amore puellae
(Grande eb conspicuum nostro quoque tempore

monstrum),—

115

Caecus adulator dirusque a. ponte satelles,
Dignus Aricinos qui mendicaret ad axes,
Blandaque devexae jactaret, basia rhedae.

Nemo magis rhombum stupuit ; nam plurima dixit

ln laevam conversu83 at illi dextrajacebun
Sic pugnas Cilicis laudabat, et ictus,

Belua.

120

Et pegma, et pueros inde ad velaria raptos.

Non cedit Veiento, sed, ut fanaticus, oestro
Percussus, Bellona, tuo, divinat et, [nqeue
Omen habes, inquit, maynz' clarique triumphi: 125
Reqem aliquem capies, aut cle temone Britanno
Excidet Aruirayws: pereyrina est belua: cernis
