210-212] Achilles was instructed
in music and fiel-l-sports by the ren-

214. Allobrogsa] ‘⁵ Gallic.''
Allobroges were a people of SM.
Gaul, between the Rhone and the
Isere. lt probably means merely
‘⁸ harbarous.'' a charge which Rufus
had apparently brought against Ci-
cero's diction. But it has been
thouqht also to refer to Sallust'sim-
putation of his having put himself
too much into the hands of the am-
bassadors of the Allobroges, during
Catiline's conspiracy. See Sall.
Cat. 41 seqq. If this is the true
rendering, Rufus had probably se-
lected the subject as the theme fora
declamation.

rhetoric-master, as part of the house-
hold expenses. “ Acoenonoe'tue '⁸ is
a fictitious name, for which ⁶ Acoe-
