Fabricios] Names of famous cen-
sorS. Q. Fabius Maximus, the well-
known conqueror of Samnium, was
censor Bc. 304. Cato is always
known as ‘⁸ Cato the censor,'' from
the austerity with which he enforeed
that office. Aemilius “Scaurus''
was censor Bc. 109. For “Fabri-
cius.'' see note on Sat. ix. 142.

91, 92.] The reference is pro·
bably to a story of Claudius Nero
and Livius. They were censors B.C.
204, and both ‘equites equo pub-
lico.' See note on Sat. x. 94, 95.
Claudius compelled his colleague to
sell his horse, on account of his con·
demnation in a trial by the people
some years previously, and Livius
retaliated. See Liv. xxix. 37. The
S‹-holiast refers the lines to an alter-
ration between Fabius Maximus (l.
90) and his colleague in the censor-
ship, P. Decius Mus. This, how-
ever, is not mentioned elsewhere :—
they had a dispute in their joint
consulship nine years afterwards.
See Liv. x. 24.
