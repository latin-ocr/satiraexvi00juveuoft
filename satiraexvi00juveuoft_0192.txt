93] ISiS was supposed to puniSh two famous Greek mnners of this

with blindness those who invoked

her to witness a falsehood. The “ sis-
trum '' was a musical instrument used
in the worship of Isis, and which
she is herself represented as holding
in her right hand. The sound was
produced by rattling four bars of
metal looscly secured in an oval
frame with a handle; hence the term
·‘ sistrum,'‘ from σεὶω. For the
worship of Isis at Rome, see note on
Sat. vi. 528, 529.

95. phthisis, fio] Bodily infirmi-
ties inflicted by the gods on perjurers.
“Dimidium crus,'' i. e. amputated.
See note on Sat. v. 84.

96. sunt tanti] This has been read
without the interrogation, and ren-
dered “are worth bearing.” ‘⁶ Tanti ”
may be thus construed no doubt3 in

Catullus.'’ See Sat. viii. 186 and
note. “ Facundus '⁸ is another read-
ing for “fugitivus'‘ See Facciol. Lex.
v. ‘ scurra.' It is perhaps better, as
the construction ‘fugitivus scurra'
(the actor aud the part acted by him,
in apposition) is harsh and unusual.
