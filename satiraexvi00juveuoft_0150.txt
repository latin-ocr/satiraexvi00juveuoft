JUVENALIS

Summos posse viros et magna exempla daturos
Vervecum in patria crassoque sub aere nasci. 51)
Ridebat curas, nec non et gaudia vulgi,
Interdum et lacrumas, quum Fortunae ipsc minaci
Mandaret laqueum, mediumque ostenderet unguem .
Ergo supervacua Qirpernicioea petuntur,
Propter quae fas est genua incerare deorumss? 55
Quosdam praecipitat subjecta potentia magnae
Invidiae3 mergit longa atque insignis honorum
Pagina3 descendunt statuae restemque sequuntur.
Ipsas deinde rotas bigarum impacta securis
Caedit, et immeritis franguntur crura caballis. 60

ε Jam strfflun‘t igneS, jam follibus atque caminis

Ardet, adoratum populo caput, et crepat ingens
Sejanus : deinde ex facie toto orbe secunda

50. vervecum—nasci] i. e. even at
Abdera, the nativos of which werc
notoriously dull. See Mart. Ep. x.
25. 4, ‘⁶ Abderitanae pectora plebis
habes.” “ vervecum in patria 'l is
used because Tin-ave, in which Ab·
dera was situatffll, was principally a
pastoral country, its hiily character
adapting it sor sheep-walks. There
is of course, ton, a reference to the
stupidity ofa wether; cf. our ‘⁴ mut-
ton-head.''

53. mandaret laqueum] “Bade
her go and he lianged.”

ib. mediuquae - unguem] i. e.
‘ digitum.' To point the middle
finger (“infa1nis digitus,” Pers. ii.
33) was a mode of insuit.

55. genua incerare deornm] Vo-
taries wrote out their prayers, and
hung them on the knees of the
images. “incerare'‘ is used b‹›cause
the writing was on waxen tablets.
See note on Sat. i. 63.

58. payimt] The scroll containing
the ‘tituli' of the ancestral ‘ima-
gines' See note on Sat. v. 110.

59, 60. binarum—caballis] The
triumphai ‹·hariot and horses on
which the statue was seated.

63. Sejanus] The minister of Ti-
berius, over whom he had acquired
a complete ascendancy. During the

time Sejanus was in power, his fa-
vour at court, and influence in all
departments of the state, made his
position that of an eastern vizier.
This was especially the case after he
obtained the command of the Prae-
torian guard, whom he quartered in
one body just outside the city, and
thus kept it in military terror. See
note on l. 94, 95 post.

After some years, Tiberius began
to suspect that his minister was aim-
ing at the supreme power himself,
and determined on his ruin accord-
ingly. Sejanus was amused by pro-
mises of marrying Livia (the sister
of Germanicus), and being elevated
to the joint tribunate with the em-
peror, both of which had formed part
of his schemes. When the time ap-
peared ripe for striking a blow, Macro
was sent to Rome for that purpose,
the emperor himself remaining in
his retirement at Capreae3 see 1. 71,
73. Macro deprived Sejanus of his
command, and at the same time pro-
duced to the senate a letter, which,
although obscurely worded, implied
that Tiberius wished to be protected
from his minister. See l. 71, 72;
and ef 1. 84, 85, “poenas exigat . . .
Ut male defensus.'’ The intimatiou
was acted upon3 Sejanus was exe-
