Haud impunitum quondam fore, quod dubitaret

rodotus (vi. 86). Leotychidcs and
Cleomenes, the two kings of Sparta,
had left some Aeginetan prisoners
in charge at Athens, whom the Athe-
nians, after the death of Cleomenes,
refused to deliver up to Leotychides
alone. The latter rebuked their per-
fidy, and told them what had hap-
pened at Sparta in the case of Glau-
cus. He was sorely tempted to ‹letain
some money which had been left
with him as a deposit (παρακατα-
θήκη), and went so far as to consult
the Delphic oracle as to the expedi-

successful as it dcserved to be.
