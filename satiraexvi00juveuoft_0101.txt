SATIRA VI. 595 -629, 93

Inde animi caligo et magna oblivio rerum,
Quas modo gessisti. Tamen hoc tolerabile, si non
Et furere incipias, ut avunculus ille Neronis, 615

Quae non faciet quod Principis uxor?

Insanum. Minus ergo nocens erit Agrippinae 620
Ille senis, tremulumque eaput descendere jussit

Haecposcit ferrum atque igneS, haee potio torquet:

Haec lacerat mixtos Equitum cum sanguine Patres.

Tanti partus equae, tanti una venefica constat ἒ 026
Oderunt natos de pellice ;—-—nemo repugnet,

husband.
Cui totam tremuli frontem Caesonia pulli
Infudit.
Ardebant cuncta et fracta compage ruebant,
Non aliter, quam si fecisset Juno maritum
Boletus : siquidem unius praecordia pressit
In coelum, et longam manantia labra salivam.

ib. inde] From these love-spells.

615. avunculus—Neronis] i. e.
Caligula. Caesonia (l. 016) was his
wife, and secured his constancy by
love-potions, which were thought to
haye unsettled his intellect.

616. frontem—pulli] i. e. (by an
hyperbole) the Hippomanes; see
l. 133 above. This was an alleged
excrescence or. a foal’s forehead,
. which drove the dam mad if she
smeltit3 hence the name ‘hippo-
manes' The dam accordingly tore
off the substance and swallowed it.
She was often, however, anticipated,
as it was collected for use in love-
charms. Cf. Virg. Aen. iv, 515,
“nascentis equi de fronte revulsus
Et matri praereptus amor.''

618. ardebant—ruebant] From the
frantie conduct of Caligula in his
del-augement‚ occasioned by Caeso-
nia's potions. See note on l. 615.
‘⁴ Cuncta,” i. e. “the whole empire.''

620, 621. Ayripp

. boletus] See
note on Sat. v. 147.

(fil-623] ‘⁸ Since that only put
an end to one old man.

621, pressit] ‘⁸ stoppcd.”

(522, 623. tremulum capum—Ion-
‚aum-salivam] Claudius is similarly
described by Suetonius; ‘⁴ spumante
rictu: caput semper tremulumf
Claud. 30.

ib. descendere—in coelum] To re-
ceive apotheosis. St c note on l. 115.
The descendere is of course highly
ironieal.

624, 625] “ Whereas Caligula's
poison (⁶ haec: see note on l. 615)
led to his practisiug every kind of
cruelry.'' Caligula's thirst for blood
was as insatiable as Marat's. It was
emboiied in his welLknown wish,
“Utinam populus Romanus unam
cervicem haberet !'' Suet. Cal. 30.

627-630.J ⁵⁴ One could no*> ob-
ject, perhaps. if they only poisoned
their husband's illegitimate children
(⁶ natos de pellice'>. or, as things
go, his child by a f01me1· marriage
(‘privignum'). The mischief is
that, now-a—days, they poison tlzeir
own.''

6'29. pupilli] A woman was in-
capacitated from being guardian
