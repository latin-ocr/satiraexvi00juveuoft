Crediderim, aut tenui percusswm verbere Circes

Solus enim hoc Ithacus nullo sub teste canebat.

formation is detailed Od. x. ⁶23?—
240. Circe gave the sailors some
‹lruggcdxvxzrhvfflndthenstruckthem
with a wand, which turned them
into swine. Ulysses partook of the
κυκεών, like the party who had pre-
ceded him, but escaped by using an
antidote3 so that the moral reflec-
tion in Hor. Ep. i. 2. 24 is not quite
accurate. Elpenor was oue of the
‹trew3 see Od. x. 552-560. When
Circe discovered who Ulysses was,
she restored the sailors to their na·
tural shape. and entertained them
hospitably. Elpenor enjoyed himself
so much, that on suddenly waking
up next morning he walked out of
the doorwav of a loft where he had
slept, instezid of going down the lad-
«ler. As might be expected, he broke
his neck.

'35. Coptos] The city was ‘ Copti,
orum,' as well as ‘Coptos, i,' the
form l. 28. The old reading was
⁴ Ombos,' but it seems impossible to
support it, notwithstanding the “su-
per'' in 128. ‘Ombi' is ninety miles

higher up the river than Tentyra, «

whereas Coptos is nearly opposite to
it,so thatthe ‘finitimos' (l. 33) almost
disposes of the question in a quarrel
so purely local as that which Ju-
venal describes. The correction
⁶ Coptos ' was naturally suggested by
the word ‘ Combos,' which was found
in many of the MSS. for Ombos.
