SATIRA Ι.
INTRODUCTORY.

1-18.] The recitation of original
poetry was much in fashion at Rome
(see Sat. vii. 39-47; 82-87) ς the
subjects being commonly mytholo-
gical or heroic. Nothing is known
of the pieces or poets referred to in
· these lines.

2. Theseide] like “ Aeneis.” Musa.
is said to be the substantive under-
stood.

ib. toties] It was so long, that it
took several days reciting.

3. lassatas] sub. “ fabulas.'' “ Do-
mestic comedies.'' The Roman stage,
like our own, had the broad distinc—
tion of ‘ regular* comedy, and sarce.
The latter was of home growth‚ and
compl-ised two kinds, the “ mimus.''
-pantomime. or low farce. which was
mere gesticulation3 and the “ Atel-
lanae fabulae'' (introduced {rom
Campania), which were more refined
in character, and included a good deal
of dialogue. The regular comed y, on
the other hand, was essentially Greek.
At first, indeed, it was a mere
transcript, preserving the Greek
names, dress, and scenes, as well
as the plot and dialogue; but lat-
terly only the two latter were re—

tained, and the piece in other re-
spects was brought out with a Roman
cast. Greek comedies thus adam-d
were called ‘ togatae‚' from the
Roman costume used3 the former
class. or mere transcripte, being now
termed ‘ palliatae,' from their Greek
dress. See Hor. A. P. 286-‘288 ε

“——vestigia Graeca

Ausi desei-cre, et celebrare domes-
tica facta,

Vel qui praetextas, vel qui docuere
toyatasff’

The ‘praetextas' (i. e. praetextatas
fabulas) in this passage of Horace,
were comedies in which official or
distinguished personages were re-
presented3 thus resembling the
English ‘genteel ' coniedy of the last
century.

4. ingens] This is clearly an epi-
thet of the poem, not of the man.

5, 6. summi libri-nmryz‘ne—teryo]
Books, i. e. published compositions‚
were written either on parchment
(ς membrana'), or on a material ob-
tained from the fine pellicle which
surrounds the papyrus, and from
which the term ‘liber' is derived.
