80. duas res optut] “has but two
wants.''

81. panem] There is no reason
for supposing that this refers to the
public distribution mentioned in the
note to Sat. vii. 17⁴. It is merely
specified as a necessary of life, and
so humorously coupled with ‘⁶ Cir—
censes.''

ib. Circenses] sub. “ludos.” See
note on Sat. iii. 223.

ib. perituros] Be put to death
with Sejanus.

peror may avenge himself on the
citizens, as Ajax did on the sheep in
the Greek camp. 'she story is well
known from the tragedy of Sopho-
cles; see Aj. 296-303.

86. in ripa] See note on 1. 63.

87, 88] “ But be sure that our
slaves see us do it, lest some one of
them deny the fact. and accuse ns.''
Political charges were constantly
brought by slaves against their mas-
ters, who lived in much dread of
them on this account.
