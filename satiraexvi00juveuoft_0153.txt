SATIRA X.

80—97. 145

Haec cupias P—Eb qui nolunt occidere quemquam,
Posse volunt. Sed quae praeclara el: prospera tanti,

have the army entirely under your
command.'' This would of course
be a chief engine of power to an am-
bitious man, and as such Sejanus
had used it. See note on l. 63 above.
That this is the general meaning of
the passage it seems impossible to
doubt. The usual explanation given
is, *⁸ you would like to receive these
appoiutments yourself.” But this
does not agree with the context: be-
sides which, “vis egregios equites''
could not, by any violence ofconstruc-
tion, be taken to mean, ‘⁸ you would
wish to be an ⁵ egregius eques ⁸ your-
self.'’ Itis clear, therefore, that the
meaning is not “preferment‚” but
‘¹' patronage.'' On the other hand, it
seems also clear that the patronage
here referred to is confined to mili-
tary appointments. Its possession is
also viewed notin the aspect familiar
to us, but as a means of acquiring
absolute power in the state3 such
as the command of a military force
quartered in the capital cannot fail
to give. See l. 96, 97, “ Et qui no-
lunt occidere quemquam Posse vo-
lunt.‘' See also the earlier part of
this note. and note on l. 63 above.

, Assuming, therefore, the above as
the general meaning of the passage,
the explanation of the particular
terms used will be as follows :—

(l) “Pila'' The ‘primipilatus'
is meant. ⁴ Primipilus ' was the
name given under the Republic to
the first centurion of the first ma-
niple of the ‘triariL' The Roman
army was at that time arranged in
three lines. The ‘hastati' and ⁸ prin·
cipes' formed the two front lines,
aud the ‘triarii' the third. The lat-
ter were a rese-rve of vetelan soldiers,
each of whom carried two ‘pila ' or
javelins, leading to the name ⁴ primi-
pilus ' above, and to the use of
⁸ pila' here for the appointment
itself. For the same reason the ⁶ has-
tati ' and ‘principes‚' who formed
the two front lines, were collectively

termed ‘ antepilani.'

In the decline of the Republir·
this arrangement fell into disuse, and
the legions were divided iuto ten co—
horts‚ each containingthree maniples.
and each maniple containing two
centuries. The entire legion, there-
fore, now consisted ofthirty maniples
and sixty centuries. The name ⁸ pri-
mipilus,' however, was still retained,
and was applied perhaps to the first
centurion of the first cohort, or ‘ co-
hors milliaria?

The ‘primipilus,‘ both under the
Republic and Empire, had charge of
the engle of the legion. See Sat.
xiv. 197, and note on Sat. ii. 101.
He was also an ex officio member
of the general's council ς and re-
tired ‘ primipili ' had a rank, that of
‘ primipilaris,5 just as those who had
served the office of consul ranked as
‘consulares' From the lucrative
character of the appointment it is
called (Sat. xiv. 197) “locupletem
aquilam.''

It should be obser-ved that ‘pri-
mus pilus' was properly the first
maniple of the ‘triarii' itself. So
that ‘primipilus' is really an inac-
curate expression for ‘primi pili cen-
turio*

(2) ‘⁴ CohorteS.'' The appointment
of ‘praefectus cohortis ’ is meant.
See note on Sat. vii. 92.

The above terms, ‘*pila'' and “co-
hortes,” refer, it will be seen, to mi—
litary appoz'nlments. In those which
followin l. 95, the “egregios equites ’“
and “castra domestica‚” the sense
rather changes, and the meaning is,
“you would like to have these bodies
subservient to )·ou.” The same Ena-
lish verb will, however, serve for
both lines,-—-“hare the disposal of.''

(3) ‘ Egregios equites? ‘⁴ The se-
lect kn‘ghts.'' This is usually taken
to mean the ‘illustres (or ‘splen-
didi') equites' of Tac. Ann. xv, 4:
see the note of Lipsius there. This,
however, can hardly be correct. It
