‘ excipienti: the more usual phrase.
But the “quis dabit . . . . quantuni
‹laret'' would then have no sense,
as it must mean a payment which
any one might make in his nrivate
vanasity, not that of a public of-
ficia .

105] The patron quotes Horace

·109, 110.1 “or if he has at his
side one, still more eager than the

‹lvht.'' Properly “nomen'' is the
debtor‘s name written in the “co-
‹lex‚‘' or ledger; but it is of constant
use in Latin in the secondary senze
of ·‘debt.'' The creditor of 1. 108
(who is the “illo ” in 109) is suing
fin- debt, where the claim is not
conlmted: the “acrior'' (creditor) in
1. 109, llO. is suine: where itis: so
that the “dubium'' is emphatic. For

of course greatly increased the ex-
eitement of tlie races. See note on
