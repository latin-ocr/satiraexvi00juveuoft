scribis Musis et Apolline nullo
Laudari ‹lebes3 hoc Ciceronis ha-
bes.'' His own contemporaries were
equally hard upon his poetical at-
tempts‚ and made Cicero very an-
gry. See Cic. in Pisones) extr. 30:
“Scire cupio, quid tandem isto in
versu reprehendas, ‘cedant arma
togae?' . . . At in altero illo,
inquit, haeres, ‘Concedat laurea
linguae,''' διο. This line, “Cedant
arma togae,'' “ concedat laurea lin-
guae‚'' is also from the poem ‘⁶ De
meis temporibus.”

126. volveris—pronum] The
well—known Philippica secanda.
1: is the most masterly of all the
speeches against Antony. See note
on l. 120 above. For “ volveris ''
see note on Sat. i. 5, 6.

126-132.] The fate of Demos-
thenes. After the death of Alex-
ander, Demosthenes succeeded in
forming a general confederacy under
the Athenians against the Macedo-
nian power. After the battle of
Cranon however (κο. 322) the alli-
ance fell to pieces, and Antipater
marched against Athens, and de-
manded the surrender of Demos-
thenes. The latter had fied to the
temple of Poseidon at Calauria; but
finding that he was to be given up
to Antipater, destroyed himself by
poison3 the ‘⁴ saevus-exitu& of 1.

126, 127.

128. theatri] After the theatro os
Dionysus was built, Rc. 340, the
ἐκκλησία was held there instead of
in the Pnyx. But perhaps ‘⁶ thea-
trum ” is used only in its sccondnry
meaning of ‘⁴ an assen1bly.‘' So
Cic. de Divin. i. ‘282 “magnificen-
tissimum senatus—consultum fre-
quentissimo theatro incredibili cla-
more et plausu compr‹›batum.”

130—132.] The father of De>
mosthenes was a sword-cutler.

133. truncis] (adjective) '⁵ head-
less.'' The “tropaeum'' was ori-
ginally formed on the field of bat·
tle, by pollarding a tree⁷ and sns-
pending the spoils from it. So Virg.
Aen. xi. 5—8: “Ingentem quei·-
cnm decisis undique ramis Consti-
tuit tumulo fulgentiaque induit
arma, Mezenti ducis exuvias, uhi.
magne, tropaeum, A1·mipotens.''
The shape thus given was always
retained by the “ tropaeum.”

135. curtum teuzone] i. e. ‘carens'
‘⁴ Docked of.''

136. arcu] scil. ‘ triumphali ι’ such
as that of Titus at Rome.

ib. tristis captivas] The bas-relies
on the upper part of the arch repre-
sented the victor treading the ‹le-
feated army under foot.

138. endoperator] Sat. iv, 29, and
note.
