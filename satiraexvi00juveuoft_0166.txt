318—321.] “But your handsome
boy, you think, will at least only be
thus criminal where he loz-es. Quite
the contrary. You will find him do
it for mere profit. He will strip his
wretched companion even of her
trinkets.” Endymion was the hand-
some hunter of Mount Latmus, be-
loved by Selene (the moon). She
laid him to perpetual sleep in a ea-
vern of the mountain, that she might
visit him without interruption.

324—345] ‘⁴ But you will say
he may be pure-minded; what mis-
chief will his beauty then do him Ρ
Did then purity save Hippolytus or
Bellerophon? or save Silius in our
own time?'' The story of Hippo-
lytus is well known from the ex-
quisite tragedy of Euripides. His
spotless life provoked the displcasuie

of Aphrodite, who inspired his step·
mother, Phaedra, with a fatal pae-
sion. This however Hippolytus re-
fused to gratify. Phaedra revenged
herself by committing suicide, leav-
ing a written letter in which she ac-
cused Hippolytus of havmgattempted
her chastity. His father, Theseus,
acted upon the statement. Poseidon
had promised to grant any three
prayers which he might addi-css to
him, and Theseus now preferred one
for his eon's death. As Hippolytus
drove along the coast to quit Attica,
his horses were scared by a sea-
monster sent by Poseidon, and Hip-
polytus was thrown from the chariot
and mortally injured. Artemis,
whom Hippolytus had worshipped,
appeared to him as he was dying,
and apprised Theseus of his error.
Hippolytus is said to have been
restored to life by Aesculapius. Ac·
cording to a tradition adopted by
Virgil (Aen. vii. 774-777), 118 was
carried by Artemis to the grove of
Aricia in Latium, where he was
worshipped under the name of Vir-
bius.

Bellerophon narrowly escaped the
same fate at the court of Proetus,
