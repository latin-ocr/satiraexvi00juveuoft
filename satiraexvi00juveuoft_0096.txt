flced to lsis. Sec Ov. Fast. i. 453,
454, “unser Det jecur in lances,
Inachi lauta, tuas.” Geese were also
the favonrite diet of the Egyptian

the countr)¹ used for the people.

ib. ‹treunam—in ‹cm-em] Jews
were occasionally in bad odour at
Rome under the empire. See Acts
xviii. 2, διὰ τὸ διατεταχέναι
Κλαύδιον χωρίζεσθαι πάντας τοὺς
Ἰουδαίους ἐκ τῆς Ῥώμης. So

tur qui vel improfessi ,Iudaicam

oracle had been destroyed by Nero.
It was restored by Hadrian, but
subsequently to the publication of
this Satire. The oracle was finally
suppressed by Theodosius.

557-559.] Otho's insurrection
against Galba was in great part due
to the suggestions of the astrologer
Ptolemaeus (called “Seleucus ” in
Sueton. Otho. 4). See Tac. Hist. i.
22-36, “Ptolemaeus jam et sceleris
instructor'' (cap. 22). Galba was

civis'' of l. 559.

557. saepius exsul] Astrology was
prohibited by law at Rome. The
words of Tacitus (cap. 22 above)
are, “genus hominnm . . . quod in
civitate nostra et prohibebitur sem-
per, et retinebitur.” Pel-sons prac-
tising it were punished with imprison-
ment or exile. See ll. 561, 562.
