Maenades. Ο quantus tunc illis mentibus ardor ἕ)
Et quis tunchominum contemtor numinis? aut quis
Simpuvium ridere Numae, nigrumque catinum,
Et Vaticano fragiles de monte patellas

Audio, quid veteres oliin moneatis amici: 346
Pone seram ,· cohibe. Sed quis custodiet ipsos
Custodes ? Cauta est, et ab illis incipit uxor.
Jamqueeademsunnnis pariter minimisquelibido,
Nec melior, silicem pedibus quae conterit atrum,
Quam quae longorum vehitur cervice Syrorum. 351
Ut spectet ludos, conducit Ogulnia vestem,
Condueit comites, sellam, cervical, amicas,
Nutricem, et flavam, cui det mandata, puellam;
Haec tamen, argenti superest quodcumque paterni,
Levibus athletis, ac vasa novissima, donat. 356
Multis res angusta domi est ,τ sed nulla pudorem
Paupertatis habet, nec se metitur ad illum,
Quem dedit haec posuitque, niodum. Tamen, utile

342. tunc] in the old times (those
referred to l. 287 seqq ).

345. Clodius] ⁵· At what altars
is‘there not a Clodius now Ρ ” Clo-
dius was one of the most profligate
of the Roman nobles. ln the year 62
B.c. he intrudcd on the rites ofthe
⁴ Bona Dea,' see note on Sat. i1. 86,
87. This was at Caesar-'s house, whose
wife Pompeia was engaged in cele-
brating the festival. Clodius entered
the house disguised as a female uin—
sician. He was impeached sor this
act of sacrilege, but acqui tted through
private interest. An alibi, which
Clodius attempted to set up, was
disproved by Cicero's evidence. Clo-
dius accordingly became the impla-
cable enemy of the latter, and in his
tribunate, B.c. 59, passed a series of
measures which ended in Cicero's
withdrawal into exile. Eventually
Clodius was killed by the followers of

Milo in a scuffle on theroad to Lanu-
vium. Cicero's uranon, 'Pro Milone,'
was compost-d on this occasion.

351. cervice] i. e. in the litter
borne on the shoulders of slaves.
llere these are Syrians. ln Sat. iii.
240, the bearer is a Liburnian. Cf.
Sat. i. (54.

352-357] “Ogulnia is so poor
that she has to hire even the equipage
with which she attends the gameS.
And yet she will squander her last
plato orporeelain on athletes.'' There
is a relinenlent of satire in speaking
ofthe garnies as a necessary of life.
Cf. Sat. x. 80 81.

357. nulla] ‘⁴ no woman.'' See
l. 362.

travagance.''
