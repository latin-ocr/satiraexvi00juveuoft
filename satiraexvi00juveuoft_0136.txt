Ante pedes Domiti longum tu pone Thyestae
Syrma vel Antigones seu personam MelanippeS‚
Et de marmoreo citharam suspende colosso. 230

Inveniet quisquam sublimius? Arma tamen vos

Nocturna et: flammas domibus templisque parastis,

volted from Nero ΑΛ). 68. Verginius
was opposed to the prctensions of
Vindex and Galba. On finding that
the former was aspiring to the em-
pire, Verginius marched against hini,
and defeated him in a pitched battle
near Vesontio (Besanqou). Vindex
fell in this engagement, and the i=sue
ofthe revolt seemed still uncertain.
Meanwhile, however, a conspiracy
had been organized in Rome itself

there. Nero was wholly without de-
fence, and to escape falling into the
hands of the conspirators committed
suicide at the house of his freedman
Phaon near Rome.
