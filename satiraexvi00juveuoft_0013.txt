Flaminiam3 (puer Automedon nam lora benebat,

135-137‚ it would seem to have
become the specific meaning of the
term ‘ circumscriptio 3 ’ which in ear—
lier Latin means cozenage of any
kind.

in Africa, and convicted of “repe

ra an.

iti. ab octava] sub. “ hora.'' This
was properly the hour for taking the
bath, the ⁴‘ coena '' not being taken
till an hour afterwards.

49, 50. fruitur dis iratis] ‘⁴ Quite
enjoys their displeasure.''

’ 50. victrix· provincia] scil. Africa,

, see on l. 49.

51. Venusina] ‘⁴ Horatian 3 ''
from his birth-place, Venusia in
Apulia.

ib. lucerna] lamp: by the light
of which he wrote, and so, his satire.
We should say ‘¹' the Horatian pen‚''
but the classical use is retained in the
word‘ ⁶·1ucub1ationss' and also in a
phrase, now somewhat antiquatel,
of a composition‘ ‘smelling of the
lamp p, i.e. over- elabor.ated

“ fabulas.'’

53, 54. muyitum-volantem] The

(who has sold his wife's honour,)

takes the adulterer's ⁶ haereditas ' in
trust for her, since (si) she, as an
adulteress, cannot be a ‘ haeres' her-
self.'' This was under a law of Do-
mitian. See Suet. Dom 8. The
reference might possibly be to the
Lex Voconia? by which a wife could
not take an ‘'haereditas'' if hel hus-
bands census exceeded a certain
amount. But there would be no
special point in this. Domitian's
law only applied to a convictesl adul-
teress, but it is obvious that in a
case like the present, there would
be the risle of a conviction at any
time.

56, 57.] “well schooled to look
at the cessing, or snore, with still
wakeful nostril, over his cup,'' i.e
while the wife and her paramour
exi-hange caresses.
