The guests were arranged in nu-
merical order, beginning with the
right-hand couch (as you stood at the
bottom or open side), the guest near-

tus.' The ‘ medius lectus' (that at
the top) was similarly arranged, and
so on to No. 9, who lay nearest to
the bottom on the left-hand conch,

the stars are paling, or while the
chill wain of Bootes is still lazily
wheeling round.''

24. succida] Newly shorn. Lit.
‘suc-cidus' is “having the jujce in
it,'‘ like fresh-gathered fruit. Here
it is applied by metaphor to re—
