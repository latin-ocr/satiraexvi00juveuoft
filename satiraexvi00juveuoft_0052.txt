26, 27] “ You might buy a large
estate in the provinces at that price,
or nearer home a still larger one.''
Landed investments in the provinces
were in fashion, which loxvered the
price of even good land in Italy.
‘ Appulia ' is used with particular
force, as it was the best grazing-land
in Italy. See Sat. ix. 55 and note.

29. endoperatorem] Lengthened
form of ⁴ imperator.’ ⁴ Eudo ' or
‘indu ' stood for ‘ in ' in the old
Latin.

31. Palam] The Palatine hi!l;
originally Pallanteum, and shortened
into Palatium. Under Augustus it
became the imperial residem-e, and
was entirely occupied by buildings of
the Conrt, with a temple of Apollo,
and public library contiguous. See
Hor. Ep. i. 3. 17, “Scripta Palati-
nus quaecunque accepit Apollo.” In
the Latinity of the empire it is there-
fore equivalent to our “ palace.”

3⁴2. princeps Equitum] Probably
no office is designated ; the term
merely means ‘⁶ a leading man
amongst.”

33. municipes-siluros] “the com-
patriot shads of his Pharian stock-in-
trade.'' Crispinus was an Egyptian3
see l. 24 and note ς hence the shads
are called his ‘ municipes' or sellow-

burghers. He had probably hawked
them dried about the villages. ⁴ Pha-
ria ' means Egypt generally, from
the well-known Pharos.

34, 35. licet et considere—cantan-
dum] “And you may as well be
seated about it, for it is grave ear-

37, 38.] V‹spasian‚ the first of the
Flavia gens who became emperor,
was suet-eeded by his sons Titus and
(subsequently) Domitian. With the
latter the Flavian dynasty terininated
at this period, although it was revived
in the constantines.

38. cah-o Neroni] ‘⁶ Nero the
bald;'' as if it were an epithet by
which one monarch was distinguished
from a predecessor of the same name.
The meaning of course is that Domi-
tian was Nero over again in tyranny.
From a passage in Ausonius, the
nickname would seem to have been
given by others besides Juvenal.
Domitian was extremely sensitive
on the score of his baldness.

ib. serviret] Domitian was the
fust emperor who assumed the title
of ⁴· Dominus.''

40. Dorica] Ancon is asea-port
in Picenum, on the Adriati03 the
modern Ancona. [t was colonized
