“ Achoris Aurunci spolium‚’' quo se ille videbab 100
Armatum, quum jam tolli vexilla jubereb.

Res memoranda novis annalibus atque recenti
Historia speculum civilis sarcina belli!

Nimirum summi ducis est, occidere Galbam,

and cos-

Et curare cutem 3 summi constantia civis,

Et pressum in faciem digitis extendere panem ;
Quod nec in Assyrio pharetrata Semiramis orbe,

100. Actoris Aurunci spol] Ver-
batim from Virg. Aen. xii. 93.
“ spoil of a slain warrior 3⁹³ used of
course here in parody.

ib. ille] Otho.

100, 101. quo—armatum] “ with
which he saw himself (took care to
be) equipped.''

101. veailla] These were the
colours of the ⁶ manipu1i‚' or subdi-
vismns of ‘che ⁸ cohort.' The colours
of the ‘ cohort' itself were ‘⁶ signa,''
and the standand of the whole legion
was its “aquila'' 0r“eagle.'' As the
movements of the troops were en-
tirely regulated by their standards,
the phrase, ‘tollere signa' (oras here
‘ vexilla') came to mean “to
march.''

102. novis “modern.''

104-106, Otho revolted from
Galba, and the latter was killed by a
private soldier in the insurgent army.
Otho was then proclaimed emperor
(A.D. 69), and marchedagainst Vitel-
lius, by whom his troops were de-
feated about 20 miles from Bebria-
cum, a town between Verona and
Cremona. The battle was named
from Bebriacum, because Otho's
army had been encamped there.
⁸‘ Curare cutem'' is of course in
ἴοι-011110 conti-ast to “ occidere Gal-
bam,”-as 1. 107 is to 105.

106. nstin-lure] '⁶ to aim at.’'

1011] Fops‚ like Otho, instead
of washing the face, used for it a
paste of bread aud asses' milk. Cf,
Sat. vi. 461, 462. 468-473.

in the way of epithets only to Cleo-

reason for then usmg the ⁵ pressum

quendi : ''—‘· 110011νο of the rixes ιη’
Cybele : '³ lit.. “of Cybeb- 111111
speaking with tremulous voice.'' The
rites are first described, by 1110 m-
setto in which they were celebrated.
Then the two clauses, “ Cybele and
her rites‚'' stand by an hendiadys
(like “ pateris libamus et auro” for
“ pat. aureis ”) for “the rites of
Cybele.'' The public festival of
Cybele was the Megalesia3 see note
on Sat. xi. 193. She had also a
temple 011 the 1’;11;1111·.0 (sec Sat. iii.
137, and 11010), where her worship
was kept up by the emasculated
Galli. And they would seem from
this passage, and Sat. vi. 511 sq.. 10
have celrbrated their rites 111 111-,17310
lvouscs as well.
