tained in the first instance by plough-
ing round the city with a bullock and
heifer yoked, and taking care that
the sods fell inwards. The ridge thus
formed was the ‘murus3' and an
imaginary line running behind it
was the ‘post murum‚' contracted
into ‘pomoerium' The object of
adopting the inner line for the boun-
dary instead of the ‘murus ’ itself,
was probably the same as that for
which the Jewish crimina! courts
inflicted only the “ forty stripes save
one.'' instead of the forty prescribed
by Dent. xxv. 3; viz. to avoid any
accidental infringement of the limit.

The ⁸ pomoerium ' was from time
to time extended with the growth
ofthe city. There was no necessity
indeed for this being done, as the
‘agger ' was never required to be
identical with it, and there was no
restriction on building outside the
‘ pomoerium: at a certain distance.
It became the practice howeverg and
eventually the ‘pomoerium' com-
prised the greater part of ancient
Rome. The Aventine was not in-
cluded until the reign of Claudius,
probably owing to the sinister augury

taken there by Remus. No one was
competent to extend the ‘pomoe-
rium' unless he had increased the
Roman territory by conquest.
