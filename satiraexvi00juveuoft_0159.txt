Romans, however, again demanded
his surrender, and Prusias was un-
able to protect him. Seeing that
this was the case, Hannibal put an
end to his life by poison„ probably
in the year ΒΕ. 183. For “prae—
toria'' see note on Sat. i. 75.

161, 162. sedea—tyranno] The
detail of Hannibal's arrival at the
court of Prusias (of which the inci-
dent here referred to seems to have
formed part) is not preserved in any
extant history. But perhaps l. 162
merely amplifies the idea of the
“cliens'' in the preceding line. A
“cliens'' would often have to wait
for his patron in this way.

166. annulus] Hannibal carried
the poison concealed in a ring;
“hausto quod sub annuli gemma
habebat, veneno.'' Aurei. Vict. 42.
Cornel. Nepos (Hann. 12) only says,
“venenum quod semper secum ha-
bere consueverat? Theie seems no
ground for supposing a reference to
the ‘⁴ three bushels ofknights' rings”
taken at Cannae.

168. Pellaeo juveni] Alexander3
{rom his birth-place Pella in Mace-

oma.

170. ul] ‘⁶ As if he had been.''

ib. Gutture—Seripho] See Sat. i.
73: vi. 564, and notes,

171. afiyulis munitam] i. e. Ba-
bylon. The wall was built of clay
dug from the moat, and made into
11³?ng on the spot. See Herod. i.

172] Alexander's death at Ba-

bylon from a debauch is well
known.

174. velzficatns Athos] See He-
rod. vii. 122, ὸ μὲν ναυτικὸς
στρατὸς . . . . διεξέπλωσε τὴν δι-
ώρυχα τὴν εὐ τῷ ”Amy γενομένην.
See the digging of the trench de-
scribed cap. 22, ⁶23.

175, 176.] See Herod. vii. 35,
36, πεντηκοντέρους καὶ τριήρεας
συνθέντες, ἀγκύρας κατῆκαν περι·
μήκεας· ταῦτα δὲ ποιήσαντες,
κατέτεινον ἐκ ’γῆς τὰ ὅπλα . . .
ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἐγεφυρώθη ὁ πόρος,
κορμοὺς ξύλων ἐπετίθεσαν καθ-
ύπερθε τῶν ὅπλων τοῦ τόνου·
θέντες δὲ, ὕλην ἐπεφόρησαν·
κόσμῳ δὲ θέντες καὶ τὴν ὕλην,
γῆν ἐπεφόρησαν· διέβη δὲ ὁ στρα-
τὸς ἐν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρῃσι καὶ ἐν ἑπτά
εὐφρόνῃσι.
