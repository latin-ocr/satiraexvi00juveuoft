SATIRA IX.

 

AN ILL-USED DEPENDANT.

 

What is J UV. Scire velim,
{gf-Fa* tristis

quare toties mihi, Naevok,

Occurras, fronte obducta, ceu Marsya viefius.
Non erat, hae faeie miserabilior Crepereius
Pollio, qui, triplicem usuram praesbare paratus,

Circuit, eb fatuos non invenit.

Tot rugae?

Unde repenbe

Certe modico conflemus, agebas

Vernam equitem, conviva joco mordente faoetm, 10
Et salibus vehemens intra pomoeria nat-is.

6, 7. Crepereius Pollio] Some
spendthrift of the day.

7. triplioem usuram] “ 36 per
cent.'' Lit. it is “thrice the usual
interest.” The latter was paid on
the first of every mouth, and termed
‘² asses usurae·,” i. e. one ‘ as' per
hundred per mouth, and therefore
12 ‘ asses ' per hundred in the twelve-
mouth, or our “ twelve per cent.''
The ordinary term for the ‘asses
usurae' was ‘centesima-J as at the

8. fatuos mm invenit] ‘⁶ finds no

2. 66, “ Positosque vernas, ditis
examen domus, Circum renidentes
Lares.” Cf. Sat. ii. 6. 66, “ver-
nasque procaces Pasco libatis dapi-

bus.'' Hence the term became syn-
onymous with ‘scurra,' a buffoon
or parasite, in which sense it is used
here, He was had out to dinner for
the sake ofhis jests. Pollio appears
to have been of an equestrian
family.

ll. salibus—natis] “bon-mets of
the town.'' At Rome, as in the
cities founded from it, there were
two lines of inclosurc; the ‘agger'
and the ‘pomoeriumff The former
was an earthwork raised for the
military defence of the city. The
‘pomoerium,' on the other hand.
existed in theory only, and formed
the religious boundary‚ within which
alone the auspices could be taken
previously to a general assuming the
‘bmperiumf See note on Sat. vi.

The course of the ‘pomoerium'
was marked by stenes, like our pa—
rish bounds, and no building was
permitted within a certain distance
on each side of it. Its line was ascer-
