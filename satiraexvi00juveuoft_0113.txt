128. lusca] The common render-
ing is probably right. ⁵⁴ blind of one
eye? as in Sat. xf 158. ln fact, the
word seems never to mean totally
blind. Why the statue had one eye
thus closed. is another question.
“To represent Aemilius in the act
of taking aimf' is the answer gene-
rally given. But this would be a
monstrous intention to impute to a
statuary. How do we know that
Aemilius had not lost an eye—with
such effect on the features, that it
could not be disguised even in his
bmnze cast ‚9

129. Sic] i. e. by imitating this
display of Aemilius, as their only
‹iga-{neele o9f getting a practice. See 1.

guenta, made of the hom of that

134.] “ Enim'' explains the '⁶ em—
turus'' of l. 133 2-how Tongillffls,
having no money, can make such
purchases His display in dress gete
him credit. Lit. the line is “His
purple, ‘direct from the ship,' with
its Tyrian thread, guarantees his
solveucy.''

ib. stlataria] Stlata was a mer-
chant-ship‚ not merely a “ privateer,”
as it is usually rendered ς and ‘⁴ stla-
taria'' may mean ‘ imporied.' But it
is quite uncertain.

pearances.‘'

wealthy, or believed to be εο.”
