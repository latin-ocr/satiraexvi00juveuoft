were driven in the races. This wall
was called ‘spina' from its resem-
blance to a back-bonez-it was, of
course, unconnected with the sides,

At each end of the ‘spinass not
upon, but in front of it, was a
goal, called the ⁶ meta' (hence here,
‘⁴ spatium utrumque metarum ”).
This ‘meta' consisted of a base,
supporting three wooden eones or-
namented with carving. Upon the
‘ spina' itself stood, at one end, two
pillars, on which the ‘ova' were
placed. The ⁶ ova' were seven balls
of wood, so called from their shapes.
One of these was taken down at thc
termination of each of the seven
courses of the chariots, to show the

‹ spectators how many remained. On
the other end of the ‘spina' stood
two corresponding pillars, supporting
seven figures ofdolpliins; hence the
“delphinorum columnas‚'' l. 590.
These apparently served for orna—
ment only.

583. sortes ducet] draw lots.

ib. fwutem] Fortune-tellers of
that day examined the lines on the
forehead, as well as the hand.

584. poppysma] “ Α ἄσασθαι-Γ
Ποππύζειν, from which the word is
formed, is to smack the lips, or
whistle-—especially to produce the
sound made by ‹grooms in rnbbing
down a horse to keep him quiet.
The word thus got the sense of
coaxing or caressing. lt may possi-
bly have become a cant term for “ a.
gratuity.”
