SATIRA VIII.

161—192. 125

Quid facias, talem sortitus, Pontice, servum?
Nempe in Lucanos aut Tusca ergastula mittas. 180
At vos, Troiugenae‚ vobis ignoscitis, et, quae
Turpia cerdoni‚ Volesos Brutumque decebunt.
Quid, si nunquam adeo foedis adeoque pudendis
Utimur exemplis, ut non pejora supersint?

The
stage-
clown.

Consumtis opibus vocem, Damasippe‚ locasti 185

ib. Phasma Catulli] Nothing cer-
tain is known of this play, οι· of a
dramatisc Catullus⁴ He is men-
tioned again Sat⁴ xiii. 111.

ib. clamosum] “ noisy.''

187, 188] The “ Laureolus '³ was
a play, in which a bandit of that
name was represented as undergoing
crucifixion. See note on Sat. vi. 219.
The actor dexterously slipped on
one side (hence ‘veloae Lentulus')‚
and a. figure was attached to the cross
in his place. Lentulus was both a
writer and actor of ‘mimi,' but no-
thing certain is known of him. His
’ family, the Lentuli, were one of the
most distinguished of the Cornelia
geum hem-e here “dignus ve1·aC1·uce,''
ns a patrician who turned ‘histrio '
became *infamis* See l. 196, 197,

une. occasion actually inflicted by Do-
mrtian, who compclled a criminal to

being allowed to slip aside as the
actore did. See Mart. de Spect. vii.
4, ‘⁸ Nou falsa pendens in cruce Lau-
reolus.''

190. triscurria] See Lat. Dict.

191. planipedes] i. e. actors of
mimes. They did not wear the ‘ 801·-
cus' (slipper) of regular comedy.

192. Mamercorum] The principal
family in the Aemilia gens. For
“alapas‚'' see Lat. Dict. They would
usually form the staple of pantomime

192—200] “As to the nobl<s
who turn gladiatore ” <he has not be-
fore spoken of these in detail, but
they are included in the ‘pejora ' ot*
l. 184), “ it matters nothing to them
at what price they sell their lives
(lit. deaths). They do it, and that
under no tyrant's compulsion. Not,
ofcourse, that any cornpulsion should
force a man to a degrading act, even
the minor degradation of the stage.
But then there is imperial precedent
for the latter, and the amphitheatre
is the next step. Accordingly, now
we have it.'' The above seems to
be the sequence of thought, but the
