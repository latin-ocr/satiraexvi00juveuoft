JUVENALIS

Summus nempe locus, nulla non arte petitus, 110
Magnaque numinibus vota exaudita malignis.

Descendunt reges, et sicca morte tyranni.

Eloquium ac famam Demosthenis aut Ciceronis
Incipit optare, et totis Quinquatribus optat,
Quisquis adhuc uno partam colit asse Minervam,

οῖ’ Minerva at Rome bore this name.
11 was so called frou] the “ quinque
=1ws'' osthe festival, which was kept
on the 19th March, and four follow-
ina days3 or more probably because
the Isth was the fifth day after the
Ides. The rhetoric master's fec (Sat.
vii. 157) was paid at this festiva13
and it would οῖ’ course be a suitable
time to petition for the special gifts
of the goddess.

120. manus—caesa] Cicero was
one of the earliest victims to the
‘proscription' commenced by the
triunwirs, Antony, Lepidus, and
Augustus. See note on Sat. ii. 28.
His twelve Philippics against An-
tony, althou h models of eloquent-e
(see 1. 125, 26), naturally excited
the animosity oftheir object. Cicero
was athis Tusculan villa when the list
of the ‘⁴ proscribed '' was made out.
He attempted to escape by sea, but
was compelled by stress of weather
to land at Formiae, where he was
overtaken by the executioners. His
head and hands were cut off, and
nailed to the ‘rostra'in the Fo-
rum.

from a poem of Cicero's, ‘⁸ De meis
temporibus.''

lam-124] “ Had Cicero been
as bad an orator as he was poet, he
would have escaped assassination.''
Cicero's poetry was severely handled
by ancient writers, See Quintilian,
ix. 4. 41, where this unhappy line,
“ Ο fortunatam natam,'' &c.‚ is cited
to en force the warning, ‘⁶ Videndum
ne syllabae verbi prioris ultimae sint
primae sequentis.” So too Martial,
