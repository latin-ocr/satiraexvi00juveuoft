51-54.] By the strict rule of law
a son was incapable, during his fa-
ther's lifetime, of acquiring property,
aud consequently of bequeathing it
to others. 'Whatever he did acquire
was ⁴⁴ in corpore census (‘ property')
cuj us tenet regimen pater ;''—be-
longed to the father absolutely.
Under Augustus an exception to the
rule was made in favour of property
acquired by military service, which
a son was allowed to treat as his own,
and accordingly to bequeath. It was
called “castrense peculium.''

54. Coranum] The name may
have been suggested by Hor. Sat. ii.
5, which is a compendium of the
practice of legacy-hunters (capta-
tores '). See note on Sat. iv. 18-
22. ⁴ Coranus: iu the satire of Ho-
race, is a rich man who takes in one
of these ‘ captatores?

55. aera merentem] i. e. ‘ sti—
pendia.' It is the technical term for
military service.

56. captat] See note on 1. 54

ib. hunc] scil. “ Coranus.''

ib. aequus] i. e. ‘non iniquus.
Kindly toil, which brings him some
personal advantage.

57. provehit] “ leads to promo—
tion.'' The repetition of the word
“labori’' in this line is unaccount-
able; but the satire is feeble
throughout, and on this account is
often considered spurious. It per-
haps more resembles the production
of advanced life.

58. hoc] i. e. “ut‚ qui fortis erit,
sit felicissimus‚” amplifying l. 57.

58-60.] ‘⁶ It is certainly the
general's interest that this should
be so,—that merit should be re-
warded.” “ Laeti‚'' sub. '⁴ sint.'‘

60. phaleris—torquibus] These
were frequently given as good ser-
vice decorations. See Livy xxxix.
31 fin., ‘⁶ Pro concione laudati pos-
tero die, donatique a C. Calpurnio
equites phaleris.”
