JUVENALIS

Ut rebus laetis par sib mensura malorum ?
Hujus, qui trahitur, praetextam sumere mavis,

is clear that the present passage re-
fers exclusively to military appoint-
ments, while these ‘illustres equites'

were a purely ‹·ivil body, aud eligible
to no 0ffi‹·e in the army. Indeed it
may be doubted whether, at the date
of this Satirc, they had not ceased
to exist as a distinct class. The
⁸* equites ” here meant are, it is sub-

mittcd, the ‘equites equo publico,'

or strictly military knights. This
latttr elnss 11111 been ustored some
,181113 pre5iousl5‚ and the army was
now 111 unly otliceted from them3

see Suet Claud. 25. lt is, perhaps,
an allowable conjecture that they
had at this date succeedcd also to
the name of ‘illustres equites,' with
which ⁴ egregii ' here would be iden-
tical.

A few words should be added as
to this applicatiou of the term ‘equi-
tes' to two distinct bodies, one ini-
lit·u·y and the other civil. The for-
niet waus ’1118 original meaning the

‘equites' 118111(γ at fir} t, 13 the name
implies,me1‹ly the cavalry of the
homan army. Iu the θυι-111111 c-on
stitution they formed the eighteen
‘'eqioesc'riun centu1·ies,'' and were
provided with a horse at the public
expe-use; hence called ‘equites
equo publico* During the sit-ge
of Veii„ however, a change took
place iu this latter respect, and, in
addition to the · equites equo pub-
lico,' the centuries now conrprised
other knights, who served with their
own borses. Later iu the Republic a
still further change took place. The
‘equites‚ “ altliou‹rh still existing 111
name no longa seived with the
army, the cavall5 being dr'av5n ex-
clusively from the (ontiugent fui-
nished by the allied states. Under
the enipire,how·,e5e1·1s above no-
ticed this 55⁷ as again 1e5 ersed The

‘equites equo publico' were now
restored to actual service, aud formed
a highly honourable body in the
state, from which the officers of the

‘cohortes and‘ alae‚' and the mili-
tary tribunes, were chonen, as well
as the primipal magistiffatee

The application of the term‘ equi-
tes' to a purely civil body com-
menced during the period above re-
ferred to, when the military service
of the kniohts was in abeyance By
the L ex Sempronia, ΒΩ. 123, a new
order in the state was created, com-
prising all those who had a census
of 4⁰0 sestertia, without reference
to any other qu·1iificati0n.See note
on Sat. iii. 154. This was the well-
know‘n equestris or,do' and in po-
pular language soon became termed
the‘ equiteS,q to the exclusion for
the time of the piopei meaning of the
word ;—thus in Cicero throughout.
For many years the ‘ equestris ordo, ⁹
or civil‘ equites, formed a highly
iufluential body in the state. B5 the
Lex Sempronia the judices' were
cbosen from them (see note on Sat.
iii. 213, vii. 116); and after the al-
teration made in this respect by Sulla
and the Lex Aurelia, B.c. 70, their
position was still maintained by the
‘publicanis or farmeis of the public
taxes, who wele usually‘ equites.
The lex Roscia Othonis assigniri<
them the first fourteen scats in the
theatre behind the orchestra, has
been already noticed. See note on
Sat. iii. 154. By degrees, however,
the order became lowered by the ad-
mis sion of persons possessed of the
required fortune, but ofobscure bi1·;th
see Sat. iii. 154—159. Augustus
endeavoured to restore it by the for-
mation of the §lite -class above re-
ferred to, the ‘illustres' or ‘splen-
didi equites. This was an upper
class within the ord==‚'c01nposed of
those who had a senatorial fortune,
aud 11110111 Augustus, thei-‚efore al—
lowed to wea1 the ‘laticlave,' which
was the distinctive badg e of the se-
nate. Hence they are also called
“equites laticlavii! The attempt,
however, seems to have wholly failed,
