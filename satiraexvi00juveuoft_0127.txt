Miserum est aliorum incumbere

Ne collapsa ruant sudductis tecta columnis.
Stratus humi palmes viduas desiderat ulmos.
Esto bonus miles, tutor bonus, arbiter idem

Integer.

Ambiguae si quando citabere testis 80

Incertaeque rei; Phalaris licet imperet, ut sis
Falsus, et admoto dictet perjuria tauro,
Summum crede nefas animam praeferre pudori
Et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas.

79. tutor] “guardiam'' either to a
minor (‘pupillus'). or to a female
possessed ofproperty. In the former
sense the word corresponded pretty
well with that with which we are
familiar, excepting that the ‘ tutela'
terminated (in the case of males) at
fourteen, when the ‘ toga virilis ' was
assumed. See note on Sat. i. 78.
The ⁸ tutela' of women was in souie
respects different‚the manage ment of
the ward's property being left to her-
self, which was not the case with mi-
nors. The tutor's sanction, however,
was required to all alienations of a
woman's property, whether by will or
during her life, as weil as to her von-
tracts and lawsuits. This sanction
was technically termed ‘auctoritas’

ib. arbiter] “jurem'' Au “arbi-
ter,'' like a‘ judex‚' was appointed by
the ‘p1·aetor.' See note on Sat. iii.
213. The functions of the two were
indeed nearly identicaL the difference
lying in the forms of the pleaffings,
and also in the ‘judicium' being
constituted with a ‘ sponsio.' This
was apenal sum, 'which the defen-
dant promised to pay (‘ spondebat ’)
if he failed, and which practically

Dignus morte perit, coenet licet ostrea eentum85
Gaurana, et Cosmi toto mergatur aeno.
Exspectata diu tandem provincia quum te
Rectorem accipiet, pone irae frena modumque,
Pone et avaritiae : miserere inopum sociorum.
Ossa vides regum vacuis exsucta medullis.

served as the provision for the plain-
ti ff's costs. See Cic. pro P. Quintio
throughout. The ‘ arbitrium' had
no such provision. It will be seen
from the above that the ‘⁴ a1·}·ite1·''
is not the same as our “arbitrator.”

f 84. causas] All sufficient motives
or.

85. dianus morte] The criminal.

ib. perit] “ really dies,'' i. e. lives
a death in life. The word thus ex-
pands the idea of l. 84.

86. Gaurana] i. e. from the Lacus
Lam-inus, near Baiae. The ² Gaurus
Mons* is the highest point of the
hills which enclose the lake. The
oysters of this district were famous.
See Sat. iv. 141 ς xi. 49. And cf.
Hor. Epod. ’2. 49, “Non me Lucrina
juverint c011chylia.”

ib. Cosmi] A famous dealer in
unuuents: also mentioued by Mar-
tial, Ep. iii. 55. l. ’3, “quacunque
venis, Cosmum migrare putamus, Et
fluere excusso cinnama fusa vit1·0.''

ib. aeno] “crucible.''

89. sociorum] See note on Sat.
v. 31 ad. fin.

90. iectura] Native sovereigns
under Roman protection.
