JUVENALIS

Plena ipso? post hunc magni delator amici
Et cito rapturus de nobilitate comesa

Quod superest, quem Massa timet, quem munere

Accipiat sane mercedem sanguinis, et sic
Palleat, ut nudis pressit qui calcibus anguem,
Aut Lugdunensem rhetor dicturus ad aram.
Quid referam, quanta siecum jecur ardeat ira,
Quum populum gregibus comitum premit hic spo-

recline at length, and was thus dis-
tinguished from its varieties, the
‘sellan' in which he could only sit,
and the ‘cathedra,' l. 65, in which
lie half reclined and half sat. ln
Matho's case, this display was per-
haps requisite to procure him prac-
tice (see Sat. vii. 129. 135-145,
and note on 1. 129); but it seems
to have harmonized with the man's
character. See Sat. xi. 34. Mart.
Ep. iv. 81 ; x. 46, which imply some—
thing of the “Serjeant Buz-fuz''
strle.

{3⁸ plena ipso] Because he was
so at.

ib. maym' delator antici] The Stoic
Heliodorus, an informer (⁴delator')
in the reign of Nero. He procul-ed
the destruction of his own pupil
Licinius Silanus.

35, 36. (Baebius) Massa—Carus
(Mettium Also ‘⁶ delatores,'' under
Domitian3 “whom eren Massa
fears.'

36. Thymele—Latinus] Actors
fo pantomime in Domitian’s reign3
the latter also h1s spy and favourite.
They acted together, usually as the
jealous husband and inconstant wife
of comedy. Sat. vi. 443 viii. 197.

ib. submissa]
iate Heliodorus.

37. submoveant] The technical

“sent;” to propi-

term for the lictors making way for
acousul. Hor. Od. ii. 16. 10, “neque
consularis summovet licto1·.'' Here
it of course means not the lictor, bnt
the consul himself; “ order you
asi‹le.''

ib. testamenta merentur] transl.
“ serve for their lesacies ;'' i. e. dis-
charge degrading offices.

40. unciolam—deuncem] ch-
tions from ἡ to st, with their re-
duced amounts‚ ὲ, &c., were often
called by the names of the 12 paits
of the ‘as ' (see Smith's Dict, Antt.
‘as') instead of using a numeml.
Thus here, ‘unciolam' for ‘ un-
ciam' is ἧς ‘deuncem' ¹¹3. This
was especially the case in stating the
shares taken by the respective '¹ hae-
redes ⁹ under a will. So Cicero pro
Caecina: “ facit haeredem ex deunce
et semuncia Caecinam 3”—‘ haeres '
of ll{ twelfths.

42. srmsmim's] transl. “ his life.''

44.] Caligula instituted rhetorical
contests at Lugdunum (Lyon). They
were held at an altar dedicated to
Augustus. Cf. Sat. xv. lll.

47. pap. prostantis] transl. “his
prostituted ward.'' The spoliator is
unknown3 but the plunder of a
ward by his guardian (tutor) was
sufficiently common. From a com-
parison of Sat. x. 222, 223, and xv.
