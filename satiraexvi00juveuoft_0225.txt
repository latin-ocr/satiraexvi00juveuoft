SATIRA XVI.

 

WHO WOULD NOT BE A SOLDIER?

 

A willing

recruit.

Quis numerare queat felicis praemia, Galle,
Militiae Ρ Nam si subeantur prospera castra,

Me pavidum excipiet tironem porta secundo
Sidere. Plus etenim fati valet hora benigni,
Quam si nos Veneris commendet epistola Marti 5
Et Samia geniti-ix quae delectatur arena.

The sol-
dier's pri-
vileges.

Commoda tractemus primum communia, quorum
Haud minimum illud erit, ne te pulsare togatus

Audeat3 immo et, si pulsetur, dissimulet, nec

Audeat excussos Praetori ostendere dentes

10

Et nigram in facie tumidis livoribus offam
Atque oculos, medico ni] promittente, relictos.

Causes

2. prospera eastra] ‘⁴ a successful
division.” A fortunate campaign
would of course raise the character
of a division, and give the recruits
a better prospect both of credit and
prize-money.

3. porta] scil. ‘ castrorum.'

5, 6.] “ Than ifa letter of intro-
duction from Venus (see note on
Sat. x. 314) or his mother Juno had
recommended us to Mars himself.''

6. Samia—arena] Cf. Virg. Aen.
j i. 15, 16, “ Quam (Carthaginem)
Juno fertur terris magis omnibus
unam Posthabita coluisse Samo.”
The latter was her favourite resi-
donce.

7. communia] scil. to all soldiers.
opposed to the privilege mentioned
in l. 51-61, which affects only those

Bardiacus judex datur haec punire volenti

who have a father living.

8. toyatus] “a civilian.'' Cf, Sat.
viii. 2403 x. 8, and Cicero's well-
known “cedant arma togae.” See
note 011 Sat. x. 122.

11. offam] “ weal.''

12. oculos-relictos] “ Leftin the
head, and that is all; the doctor
promising nothing as to your ever
seeing with them again.''

13, 14.] “Even if you have the
courage to seek redress, the juror
assigned you is the soldiers' shoe,
and their huge ancles round the tri-
bunal.” Causes in which soldiers
were concemed were tried by the
centurions. For “judex datur‚'' see
note on Sat. iii. 213, ⁶ vadimonia.'

13. Bardiacus] So called from
the Bardaei, a people of Dalmatia
