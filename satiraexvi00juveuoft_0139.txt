SATIRA VIII.

244—264. 131

Omnibus auxiliis atque omni pube Latina
Sufficiunt dis infernis Terraeque parenti :

Pluris enim Decii, quam qui servantur ab illis.
Ancilla natus trabeam et diadema Quirini

Et fasces meruit, regum ultimus ille bonorum. 260
Prodita laxabant portarum claustra tyrannis
Exsulibus juvenes ipsius Consulis, ei: quos
Magnum aliquid dubia pro libertate deceret,

father, and his son of the same name.
The former devoted himself to death
in the Latin war, B.c. 340. A vision
was seen by himself, and his col·
league T. Manlius Torquatus, which
announced that on one side the ge-
neral was doomed, on the other the
army. Decius accordingly deter-
mined to secure the victory to his
country by his own death, and
rushed into the thickest of the fight,
where he was slain. The son per-
formed a similar act of heroism in
a battle against an allied force of
Etruscans, Gauls, and others, B.c
295. Decius saw that his troops were
overmatched by the Gauls, to whom
his division was opposed, and deter-
mined on imitating the sels-sacrifice
of his father. He accordingly, in a
solemn forin of prayer, devored the
enemy to the avenging manes of the
dead, and then threw himself upon
their swords.

255, 256. legionibus] The Roman
army. “ Auxiliis,'' the contingent of
the allied states of Italy. See note
on Sat. v, 31. “Pube Latina‚’' the
Latin portion of this contingent. See
the same note.

259. Ancilla natus] The king Ser-
vius Tullius. His mother was Ocri-
sia, the wife of a noble in the Latin
town of Corniculum. She was en-
ceinte when the town was captured
by Tarquinius Priscus, and was
brought to Rome as his slave, where
she gave birth to Servius Tullius.
He gradually rose at cour‚t as well
as in popular estimation. On the
assassina: ion of Tarquin by the sons

of Ancus, Tanaquil concealed her
husband's death, and invested Ser-
vius with the functions of ‘inter-
rex.⁹ Eventually he succeeded to
the throne and founded the firs st
popular institution of Rome, the
‘comitia centuriata, by which the
were admitted to a share of
power. Hence he is here called
'⁵ regum ultimus ille bonorum.''
The second Tarquin abolished the
Sewian constitution shortly after
his accessio «1.n

known from Livy, 2. 4, 5. The
sons of Br itus too'k the lead in a

The plot was discovered by a slave
(l. 264) who informed the consuls,
and Brutus ordered his sons to be
beheaded.
