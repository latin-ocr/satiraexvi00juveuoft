166 JUVENALIS

Qualis in Oceani fluctu testudo nataret,

Clarum Trojugenis factura ac nobile fulcrum: 95
Sed nudo latere et parvis frons aerea lectis
Vile coronati caput ostendebat aselli,

Ad quod lascivi ludebant ruris alumni.

Tales ergo cibi, qualis domus atque supellex.
Tunc rudis et Graias mirari nescius artes,
Prbibus eversis, praedarum in parte reperta
Magnorum artificum frangebat pocula miles,
Ut phaleris gauderet equus, caelataque cassis
Romuleae simulacra ferae mansuescere jussae
Imperii sato, geminos sub rupe Quirinos,

Ac nudam effigiem clypeo fulgentis et hasta
Pendentisque dei perituro ostenderet hosti.
Argenti quod erat, solis fulgebat in armis.
Ponebant igitur Tusco farrata catino

Omnia tunc3 quibus invideas, si lividulus sis. 110

sidc and diminutive couch (an hen-
diadys for the bare side of the couch)
a frontlet of biass exhibited the
wreathed ass's head ;'' i. e. as its
only ornament. Hyginus (Fab. 274
init.) speaks of the couches of an-
tiquity having this decora'ion. This
was because the ass had done good
service in cropping the upper twigs
of the vine, and thus teaching the
art of pruning. Columella (x. 344,
345) mentions the practice of fixing
an ass's head flayed on the boun-
‹larics of fields, apparently in con-
nexion with some Etrurian rite.
