JUVENALIS

Poena, sed infernis hilares sine regibus umbrae.
Improbitas illo fuit admirabilis aevo.

Si juvenis vetulo non adsurrexerat, et si 55
Barbato cuicumque puer, licet ipse videret
Plura domi fraga, et majores glandis acervos.
Tam venerabile erat, praecedere quatuor annis,
Primaque par adeo sacrae lanugo senectae!

‘⁶ lt is an honesty quite portentouS.”

ib. Tuscis—libellis] Of the inter-
vention of a soothsayer. Cf. Sat. ii.
121 and note. Portenta (⁴ prodigia '),
such as those mentioned 1.(54-70,
were under the jurisdiction of the
augure and ‘liaruspices.' The for-
mer, who were the superior class,
acted ex officio in certain conven-
tional cases3 the latter were speci-
ally summoned for the occasion:—
rather as private practitioners, and
where the portent was of au ex-
ceptional kind.

Originally‚as was natural, the pro-
vince both ot· the augurs and ⁴ harus-
pices' lay in the future only. The
‘ haruspex ’ delivered his predictions
from thc appearance of the entrails
on the altar, the name being pro-
bably derived from ‘ liaruga ' (an old
Latin term for a “ vi‹eti1n'') and
‘spicio‚' the root of ‘inspic-io! The
augure, on the other hand, drew
their predictions from the ssight and
crios of birds‚-—‘avis' (contracted

into ⁴ au‚' as in ‘ auspex '), and, it is
said, ‘gai-rio? Gradually, however,
the functione of both augurs and
‘ haruspices ³ were extended to inter-

pretations of the will of heaven as ,

well past and present as future: just
as the term προφήτης, i. e. “ inter-
preter,'' in Scriptum, means a mom]
teacher as well as what we usually
call a prophet. As these ‘ prodigia'
were looked upon as an expression
of that will, the “soothsayer '⁹ was
accordingly summoned to explain
what they portended, and, where the
portent was evil, what were its causes
and the rites required to expiate it
(‘lustratio'). The rules by which
these were determined were con—
tained in certain ‘libri haruspicini,'
said to have been derived from
Etruria. Hence “ Tuscis libellis”
here, the art itself having been in-
'viented by the Etruscan soothsayer
ages.

63. coronata-aqna] The sacrifice
at a ⁶ lustratio.' See last note, aud
cf. Sat. ii. 158 and note.

64-70. bimembri—torrens] In-
stances of ‘prodigia' See note on
1. 62. They are all taken from the
accounts of those transcribed by Livy
from the public records.

64, 65. bimembri- vero] Liv.
xxvii. 11, “cum elep anti capite
puerum natum.''
