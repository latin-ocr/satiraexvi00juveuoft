valent to “ togatus‚'' 1. 8. The first
meaning of ‘paganus' is “ one who
lives in the country.'' The term
was derived from the ‘pagi‚' or for-
tified towns, which were distributed
over the country districts for the
protection of those engaged in agri-
culture. Gradually‚ however, it
came to be applied to civilium,
whether living in the country or not,
so‹that the classification ‘milites et
pagani' is of frequent occurrence.

34. contra pudorem] “in deroga-
tion of a soldier's fortune and ho-
nour'' (which would suffer by the
evidence).

36. sacramentorum] i. e. of sol·
diers. The ‘sacramentum' was the
well-known military oath. It was
taken on the ‘signa‚' and considered
especially saered;—a soldier who
violated it might be put to death
without formal trial. Cf. Hor. Od.
ii. 17. 9-12, “Non ego perfidum
Dixi sacramentum : ibimus, ibimus,
Utcunque praecedes.''

36, 37. convallem ruris aviti—aut
campum] “a slope οι· level of my
patrimonial land.''

38, 39. sacrum-libo] The Roman

50

fields were unenclosed, and their
boundaries marked by a statue of
Terminus, which usually consisted
of merely an upright stone or post.
On the sete of the ‘ Terminalia' an
altar was erecte-d near this, and
honeycombs‚ corn, and wine offered
on it, with a lamb or sucking-'pig
The ‘ Terminalia' were celebrated
every 23rd of February, at the sixth
milestone on the road to Laurentum.

41. vana—hym] Repeated from
Sat. xiii. 137. See note there.

43. exspectandus erit] “I, as a ci-
viHan, must wait for.” Opposed to
the soldiers' (“illis—-ambit,” l. 48)
privilege, a speedy hearing.

ib. annus] i. e. a year's cause—list.
I must wait its being gone through,
for it to reach (lit. begin) my case.

43. tnnc] “even at the year's end.''

44. subsellia] See on l. 14 above.

45. ponente lacernas] i. e. to as-
sume thejzcdz'cial robe.

46. Caedicio] Sat. xiii. 197.

ib. Fusco] Probably the ‘ Fuscus'
of Sat. iv, 1123 see note there.
“ Micturiente ;” transl. “ growing
impatient.”

48. illis—ambit] i. e. the soldiers.
