tunic (i. e. be sure who wears it)
when the gold baud stands off from
the throat, and is tossed by the
drooping false hair.'' Ι. e. even were
his face not visible, he would be be-
trayed by the patrician ornament of
his retiarius's tunic. See note on l.

a gold band round the neck, with
long ends like a riband. For ‘⁴ ga—

Gracchus, to whom it would attach

213, 214] Parricides were sewu

up in a sack (“ culeus '') with an ape,
snake, dog, and cock, and thrown
into the sea. By the ‘ Lex Pompeia
de Parricidiis' (which extended the
term tu the murder of other relatives
besides parents) Nero had committed
three ‘parricidia' He murdered not
only his mother Agrippina, but his
aunt Domitia and brother (by adop-
tation) Britannicus. Hence *⁶ non-
u12a;'' i. e. ‘plures' ln strictness,
indeed, although these two latter
murders constituted. under the law
above 1eferred to, the crime of ·· parri-
cidium,' they were not liable to its
specific punishment, the sewiug in the
sack. This was still confined to mur-
derers of parents and grandparents.
215. Ayamemnonz'dae] Orestes.
’ΞΜ-3221] “For Orestes (“ille,'')
1:216), although he slew his mother,
had a divine sanction for it. More-
over he did not, like Nem, murder
his other relations, nor did he ap-
pear on the stage, nor write bad
poetry.'' Nero had done all this.
See note on l. 198, 213, 214, above.
The Τρωϊκά was a composition of
Nero's, which he recited while Rome
was buming. Tae. Anu. xv. 39.
