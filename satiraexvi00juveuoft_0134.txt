well-equipped was the ‘ retiarius:
who carried only a three-pointed lance
and net. The former was called
‘ tridens' or ⁶ fuscina? See Sat. ii.
143. The latter was the ⁴ 1'ete,' from
which the ‘ retiarius ¹ took his name.
Cf. l. ⁶204, ‘⁶ pendentia retia dextra‚”
aud “ retia misit‚'' Sat. ii. 148. The
aim of the ‘ retiarius ' was to entangls
1115 opponent with the net. lf he
failed in his first throw he fied
(“ tota fugit arena‚'' 1. 206), and
tried to throw the net a second time,
before his opponent could reach him.
He was dressed only in a short tunic.
See 1. 207 ; and cf. Sat. ii. 143, ‘· tu-
nicati Gracchi.'' Opposed to the
‘retiarius,' and better armed, were
usually the ⁶ mirmillo,' ⁴ Thrax‚' and
‘ secutor.' All three of these formed
a superior class. For the ‘ mirmillo,'
see 1. ²200, and note on Sat. vi.31.
The ‘ Thrax ' wore Thracian annour,
with a short sword,—-the ‘⁸ clypeo '³
and “ falce supina ” of 1. 201, in
which the ‘ Thrax ' is described. The
‘secutor ' (l. 210) was so called from
his chasing the ⁸ retiarius ’ round the
arena if he had thrown his net un-
successfully. See above. The name
has also been derived from his
taking the place of gladiators who '
had been put hors de combat ς hence
“jussus pugnare, ”1. 210. The mean
ing of the passage is therefore, ‘He
does not even enter as a gladiator of
a superior class, such as the mir-
11110οό1- the‘ T’hr'ax (1. 200, 2⁰31)
he appears in the arena as a mere
retiarius ¹ ” (l. 203-205). Cf. Sat.
ii. 143-148 of the same Gracchus.
