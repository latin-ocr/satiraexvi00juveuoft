SATIRA XII.

Conspicitur sublimis apex, cui candida nomen
Scrofa dedit, laetis Phrygibus mirabile sumen,
Et nunquam visis triginta clara mamillis.
Tandem intrat positas inclusa per aequora moles 75

Quae pelago occurrunt medio, longeque relinquunt

75-77.] i. e. the port of Ostia.
Originally the port was formed by
the embouchure of the Tiber, and
the Ostia of the republican period
means this. The alluvial deposit of
the river, however, increased so
much, that Ostia ceased to be a
sea-port at all, and the cargoes of
ships had to be carried up the river
in barges. To remedy this, Clau-
dius excavated a new basin, pro-
vected by two piers, with an arti-
ficial island and light-house between
the-un. These are the “porrecta bra-
chia'' and ‘⁶ Tyrrhenam Pharon '¹ of
