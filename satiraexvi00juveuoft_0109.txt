the applause which it elicited. The
phrase 15 commonly taken as an hy-
perbole. Cf. Sat. iy 12, 13, where a
similar exagg‹·ration is used of the
recitet· himself. But perhaps, like
Addison's 1111111(- maker, the audi-
ence vented their enthusiasm on the
benches.

Theatrical performances took place
at the public garnies. See note on
Sat. 1·1. 67. Originally, the latter
were under the chgar«.v e of the aediles3

the empire however, the aedileship
having (101-’1111οᾱ111 impoi 111100 as the
games advan‹·ed, their management
was transferred to the praetor. The
latter, therefore, properly had these

pointment of military tribune.”
These were the‘ tribuni militares)
of whom there were four (afterwards
increased to six) in each leg 1011.
They must not be confuunded with
the “tribuni militum (um consu-
lari potestati‚” who occur in the
earlier books of Livy. These latter
were a temporary substitute for the
Consulate‚ and existed 01111 from
Rc. 444-367. The‘ tribuni mili-

tares were permanent officers, who
commanded in 1111115, aud were es-
pecially charged with the 1111111110-
1111111·0 of discipline in the legions.
As is usual with governinent situa-
tions, the appointment was in <great
request under the empire. Cf. Sat.
i. ὁδ’, x. 92. To gratify as many
applicante as possible, it was now
conferred for six months oulv, in-
stead ofa year as formerly. Hence
it is here called ‘⁴ semestri auro :¹³—
‘auro' being the ‘aureo auuul‹›,'wl1icli
the tribunes wore. The ‹luties of
the office were probably discharged
by deputy3 so that it became a
mere sinecure, and would seem from
this passage to have been bestowed
on successful 111111101·5,111 lieu of a.

90—92] The lise of .Ῐι11’;01111

this passage led to the 11001ἱ 5 110111511-

it as an attack on 1115 favourite Paris,
and sent him into honour 11110 exile 111
