161. Ihspitss qffbclu] “ with land-
'lord's aii-,³³ “ Aff‹·ctus‘' is “dispo-
sition,'' either real or assumed.

162. sim-inem] ⁴* bustliiig.'' See
note on Sat. iv. 24. ‘⁸ Cyane ¹³ is the
waitress at the tavern.

167. therumrmn calices] Cups of
the ‘ thermopolia.' These were shops
for the sale of hot driuks. They are
of course to be distinguished from
the bathing establishmeuts, also
called ‘ thermae.' See note on Sat.
vii. 233.

ib. inscriptaque lintea] The ‘ther-
mopolium ³ had probably a liuen
awning before it. with the proprie-
tor's name and a tariff of prices in-
scribed.

169. bello, Armeniae, ἅμ] Datives
after “maturus’' The latter is op—
posed to the “juvenes'' and “pueris,''

171. haee aetas] scil. “of Dama-
sippus.''

ib. Mitte Ostia] i. e. send him to
embark. The Roman port Ostia is

unquestionably meant here. See note
on Sat. xii. 75—77. The plural form,
instead ot‘ the more frequent Ostia,
ae, is found in Livy, ix. 19, “Antio
atque Ostiis tenus.'' Under the
Republic a fleet was stationed at
Ostia for the protection of the eoast3
and it must have been the usual
transport station {01- troops even after
this object had ceased. From the
“amnffiuss' ‘⁶ Rhen0‚” ιιΙεῑ1·ο,” in
the precedingline, it hasbeen thought
that Ostia means “their mouths.‘'
This, however, would he feeble, un—
]ess some town there bore this
name3 but for this, although pro-
bable enough, there is no authority.
173. percussore] ·‘cut-th1·oat.'’
174. suffitu-is] “runaway slaves.”
175. carnifices] ‘· public execu—
tioners for slaves.'' They inflicted
turture or crucifixion, according to
the offence. See note on Sat. vi. ⁶219.
176. resupinati] ‘⁴ dead-drunk ;”
lit. lyiug flat on his back. Hence
the ‘⁴ cess-«mia tympana.”
