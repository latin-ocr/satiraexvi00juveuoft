Nil pueri jaciunt, ipsam eonfiyite matrem!

Extulit} ergo gregem natorum ipsumque parentem,
Dum sibi nobilior Latonae gente videtur 176
Atque eadem scrofa Niobe secundior alba.

of Amphion (see l. 174), boasted of
her superiority to Latona. The god-

allusion to the legend of the “sus
(alba) Trigintacapi tum foetus enixa,''

dess had only two children, Apollo
-and Diana, while Niobe had six
sons and six daughters. Latona·s
children, being incensed at this
presumption, slew those of Niobe.
She was herself petrified on Mount
Sisyphus.

174. Amphion] The father,
Niobe's husband. The exclamation
in l. 173, “ipsam configite matrem!”
is of course hnmorous. Niobe might
have said this herself; Juvenal
makes her husband say it for her.

ib. contrahit] “tighter bends;''
lit. brings the ends together3 the
result of drawing the string.

175. eoetulit] ‘⁶ bu1·i‹›d.'' lt is the
technical term3 lit. carried out for
burial. The nom. is Niobe.

ib. ipsum parentem] Amphion
killed himselfthrongh grief.

177. scrofa—alba] Probably in

which was found by the Trojans.
Vir-2. Aen, viii. 43. 82.

178-183.j ‘⁵ And thus with other
mei-its of the sex.'' See the enume-
ration line 162, from which one, the
‘fecundas has just been selected for
illustration. ⁶* Which of them can
compensate for your being per-
petually called upon to admire (lit.
being ‘debited' with) them? Per-
fection itself, tainted with vanity‚
sails to charm. The most devoted
husband hates what he is compelled
to be always praising.”

183. septena—horis] ‘⁶ seven hours
a day:'' i.e. more than half of it.
See note on Sat. i. 49, ‘ ab octava.'

185. rancidius] ‘more nauseous’

’.ΜΟ-230] ‘' [f you marry, itis
either for love or not. ln the
latter case you may as well save the
expense (200-205) of the ceremony.
