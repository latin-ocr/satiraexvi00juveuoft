Hippia.

Nupta Senatori comitata est Hippia ludium

Nil patriae indulsit, plorantesque improba natos,

probably had been travestied in some
farce of the day.

72—75.] *⁶ As he (Urbicus) only
performs in low comedy‚ Aelia, poor
aa she is, cau afford to fall in love
with him. It is only an Hispulla
(some wealthy lady) who can aspire
to a tragedian.'' The actors were
not only made love to, but paid
for it.

76. de qua] “ by whom‚''

77. fiat pater] transl. “may be-
come a father :'' i. e. merely that he
mixi—81] “ Go, celebrate your nup-
tials with all splendour;—and find,
by and by, some gladiator’s child in
your wife's cradle.''

78. pulpita] stages erected for
the entertainments given in honour
of the marriage.

79.] See note on l. 51, 52.

80. conopeo] Here, a child’s cra-
dle with a head 3-‹he present ‘· ber-
celonette.” ‘⁸ Testudineo,” tortoise-
shell.

ib. Lentule] Used for any one of
noble birth. ‘⁸ Nobilis '³ is of course
ironical.

81. mirmillonem] The “mirmillo'’
was the gladiator usually pitxed with
the ‘ retiarius ς’ see Sat. viii. 200.
The name arose from the figure of a
fish, μορμύρος, which they are said
to have worn on their helmets.

ib. exprimat] “ reproduce in fea—
turcl·

8¹2. Senatori] The Fabricius Vei-
ento of Sat, iii. 185, iv. 113 seqq.
See l. 113 of this Satire.

ib. ludium] i. e. Sergius. l. 105.
The original meaning ot⁴ ” ludius' is
an actor of pantoinime. It would
seem however from this passage,
compared with ll. llo-114. and l.
⁸266. that the term had now come
to comprise gladiators. L'nless in-
deed the name was Ludius SergiuS,
in which case it should have a capital.
The last syllable is elided before the
initial vowel in l. 83.

83. sttruosaque moen. L.] i.e.
Alexandria. By ⁵ Lagi' is said to be
meant Ptolemy I.‚ the well-known
general of Alexander, and his sue-
cessor in his Aegyptian dominions.
He was usually called Ptolemaeus
Lagi, sub. ' filius ς’ from his reputed
father Lagus. This is sometimes
loosely written Ptolemaeus Lagus,
of which Lagi here would be the
genitive. But perhaps it is better
to take Lagi here for the father him·-
self, used for all his descendants the
Ptolemies; i. e. the Layidae.

ib. fumosa] Here ‘'famous''
The word means any thing which
people talk of, and hence. either
famous or (as it more frequently is)
‘⁶ infamous.”

84. Canopo] Even Canopus See
Sat. xv. 46. “Urbis‚'' i. e. Rome.
‘⁵ Prodigia: '⁹ cf. Sat. ii. 121—123.
Its crimes amounted to portents.
