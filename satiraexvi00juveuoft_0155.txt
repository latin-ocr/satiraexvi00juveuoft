An Fidenarum Gabiorumque esse potestas,

Et de mensura jus dicere, vasa minora

Frangere, pannosus vacuis aedilis Ulubris Ρ
Ergo quid optandum foret, ignorasse fateris
Sejanum: nam qui nimios optabat honores

Et nimias poscebat opes, numerosa parabat

Excelsae turris tabulata, unde altior esset
Casus e‘o impulsae praeceps immane ruinae.
Quid Crassos, quid Pompeios evertit ⁴? et illum,
Ad sua qui domitos deduxit flagra Quirites ἓ

and under the later empire the
‘equites,' as a civil body, sank into
complete insignificance.

(4) The ‘casua domestica: i. e.
the Praetorian guard. Originally
this consisted of one cohort only, and
formed the body-guard of the consul
or praetor (tne terms being then iden-
tical) when on actual service. lt
was accordingly tenned the ⁶ prae-
toria cohors.' Augustus increased
the number of cohorte in the guard
to nine, and formed them into a.
separate force, part of which was
always stationed in the capital. By
the advice of Sejanus, Tiberius col-
lected the whole force in Rome, and
stationed it in a permanent camp
near the ‘ agger' of Servius Tullius;
hence the phrase here “castra do-
mestit-aff· The number of cohorts
was afterwards raised by Vitellius to
sixteen. The term for the guard
under the empire was ‘praetor-iani,'
or *praetoriae cohortes,' and their
commander was ‘praefectus prae-
toris? The post was one ofgreat in—
fluence, and was held by Sejanus
himself. See note on l. 63 above.
The reference in this passage, how-
ever, is not so much to the appoint—
ment to this post aa to the influence
acquir-ed by having the guard itself
at the minister's disposition. See
the earlier part of this note.

96. et, ui] ‘⁸ even those who.''

97, 98. ‘· But can any prosperity
compensate for a reverse of equal
magnitude?'' “Utf-par sit men—
sura:” “that you should have to

undergo'' . . .
99. hujus] scil. of Sejanus. For
“ praetextam ” see note on Sat. i.

ηπ,-

Η. 18.

100. polestas] “A magistrate ξ’-
a familiar instance of the use of the
‘abstract' for the ⁸ concrete.' The
first sense of the word is “consti-
tuted autliority.” From this it comes
to mean specifically “a magistiacy,''
and hence ‘⁶ the person invested
with it.'' It has formed the Italian
‘podesta,' which in the same way
means “a magistrate.” ¹ Fiden.
Gabiorum ε’ see note on Sat. vi. 5¹3.

lOl. vasa minora] “short uica-
sures.'' To break these was one uf
the aedile's duties.

102. Ulubris] A town os the
same class as Gabii. Sec Hor. Ep,
i. ll. 30: ‘⁶ Quod petis hic est. Est
Ulubris, animus si te non deficit
aequuS.'' The “aedile'‘ in a country—
town would be little more than a
police-serjeant, and, at Ulubrae,
probably ragged enough. Hence
‘⁵ pannosus ” here.

105-107] See Hor. Od.ii. 10. Η),
“celsae graviore casu Det-{dunt tm·-
res.” “ Praeceps ” is used as a sub-
stantive, “ downfall.'' Cf* Sat. i. 145».

108. Crassos-Pompe ios] Pl u ru ls
used for singulars. By “ Crassos “’ is
meant Licinius Crassus. the (so-call-
ed) triumvir, who was defeated and
killed by the Parthians at the battle
of Carrhae, B.c. 55. For the sate
of Pompey see l. 285. 286, and note.

109, 110. illum-Quirites] i, e.
Julius Caesar.
