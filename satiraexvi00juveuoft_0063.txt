Et cui per mediam nolis occurrere noctem,

371-39. Ipse— Virro] Your en-
tertainer.

37, 38. capaces Heliadum crustas]

“ The ample emhossments of the
Heliades3 ” i. e. of umber. It means,
of course, the goblets to which the
embossed work (“crustae'') was at-
tached. See note on Sat. i. 76. The
Heliades were Phaetou's sisters,
whose tears were turned to amber.

38. imaequales] “ studded.''

42] Sarcastically. “ Perhaps
though we must excuse him ;—the
33δὲἕῖᾅὲ ‘1¹¹³‘ ἱῖἓίῗὲςῖέἳξᾚωίαω
were probably moireable, likep the
‘crustae' and, in Virro's case, were
perhaps set either for wearing on the
finger, or affixing to a goblet when
at table. Hence, “ ad pocula trans-
fert a digitis.'' By the “quas sole-
bat'' it is n'ot meant that Aeneas
(see next note) wore these identieal
geme. What lte put on his scabbard,
Virro, and those like him, (“ ut
multi,'') displayed alternater on
their hands and drinking-cup&

45. praelatus] i. e. by Dido. See
Virg. Aen. iv. 36, 37, “despectus
Iarbas, Ductoresque alii.'' The “ju-

venis'' is ofcourse Aeneas.

46. Benez-eneanisuem's] Vatinius,
a favourite and spy of Nero, formerly
a cobbler of Beneventum. Drink-
ing-cups with nozzles were intro-
duced by him, and called “Vati-
nia'' in consequence. See Mart.
Ep. xiv. 96, ‘⁶ sutoris calicem monu-
menta Vatini Accipe ;'' also note on
l. 48 of this Sat.

48. quassatum] “ cracked.''

ib. rupto—vitro] The exchange
of broken glass for sulphur is men-
tioned iu Martial, Ep. i. 41. 4, 5,
“ Qui pallentia sulphurata fractis
Permutant vitreis.'' Cf. Ep. x. 3.
3, 4, “ Quae sulphurato nolit emta
ramento Vatiniorum proxeneta. frac-
t01·um.''

50. decocta] sub.“aqua.” water
boiled, and afterwards cooled with
snow.

51] ‘⁶ Non ” is construed with
“ eadem,” and “ modo '’ with “que-
rebar.''

52. cursor] A lackey, who ran
before carriage52 i. e. a mere out-
door servant. had in to wait. This
made the indignity the greater.
