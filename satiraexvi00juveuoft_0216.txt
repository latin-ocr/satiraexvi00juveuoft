3. mrs] The crocodile was es-
pccialiy sacred in the Thebais He-
rod. ii. 69, Τοῖσι μὲν ὀὴ τῶν Αἰ-
γυπτίων ἱροί εἱσι οἱ κροκόδειλοι,
τοῖσι δ’ οὒ, . . . οἱ δὲ περί τε Θήβας
καὶ ’τὴν Μοὶυιος λίμνην οἰκέοντες,
καὶ κάρτα ἥγηνται αὐτοὺς εἶναι
ἱρούς.

ih. saturam-ibin] The ibis was
a kind of stork„ which devoured ser-
pents. It was revered as sacred from
its utility in this respect.

5. resonant-chordae] Memnon
was an Ethiopian princ-e, the son of
Eos (Aurora). He came to the as-
sistance of Priarn in the Trojan war,
and killed Antilochus: see note on
Sat. x. ³253. He was himself killed
by Achilles. A colos—al statue of
black stone near Thebes was sup-
posed by the Greeks to represent
Memnon, and to emit a sound like
the snapping of a harp-string when
touched by the rising sun. The

statue was really that of Amunoph
ΙΙΙ. lt is one of two colossi which
are seated as the advaneed guard of
the propylaea, leading through a
sphynx avenne 1100 feet in length to
the palace-temple of Amunoph.

ib. dimidio] See on Sat. v. 84.

6. centum—portis] See ll. ix.

ηκὸσιοι δ’ a’v’ ἑκάστην Ἀνέρες ἑξ-

It is unfortunate for this poetical
conception that Thebes was wall-less,
and consequently never had gates.
The portals of temples may have
been mcant3 and the latter are suf-
ficiently numerous to justify the com-
putation,—in round numbers See
Miss Beaufort's Egyptian Sepulchres,
Longman, 1861.

1. caeruleos] sub. “ pisces 3⁸⁵ “ salt· ¹ κ

water fish.'' ‘Aeluros' (cats) is a

conjectural reading, but some oppo- ¹

sition to “ piscem fluminis” seems
required.
