JUVENALIS

Si foret exstinctus diverso ternpore, quo ΙῘεΗῃ nm„
Coeperat audaces Paris aedificare carinas.

Longa dies igitur quid eontulit? Omnia vidit 265
Eversa, et flammis Asiam ferroque cadentem.

Tunc miles tremulus

posita tulit arma tiara

Et ruit ante aram summi Jovis, ut vetulus bos,
Qui domini cultris tenue et miserabile collum ί A

Praebet, ab ingrato jam fasti-ditus aratro.

Exitus ille utcumque hominis: sed torva canino
Latravit rictu, quae post hunc vixerat, uxor.
Festino ad nostros, et regem transeo Ponti,

Et Croesum, quem vox justi facunda Solonis
Respicere ad longae jussit spatia ultima vitae. 275

274, 275.] For the story of 80101ιέ
visit to Croesus, see Herod. i. 32-
86. The king expressed his surprise
that Solon did not even give him
credit sor being the second happiest
man he had ever known. The phi-
losopher, after computing the num-
beros days in a man's life, and the
varied foxtunes of each day, enjoined
Croesus σκοπέειν . . . παντὸς χρή-
ματος τὴν τελευτὴν κῆ ἀποβή-
σεται. After his defeat by Cyrus,
Croesus was placed on a lighted pile
for execution. 80101ιέ advice now
recurred to him so forcibly that he
could not sorbeat· ejaculating his
name thrice. Cyrus, with some
trouble, drew from him the cause of
his exclamation, and considering that
the philosopher’s advice was equally
applicable to himself, ordered the
fire to be extinguished.

275. spatia ultima] The race-
course in the Circus was called “ spa-
tium,'' and the chariots ran several
times round it. Hence ‘⁶ spatia ul-
tima ” means lit. “ the last course.''
