Claudius and Nero. He was exiled
by the latter, on account of the in-
flueuce lie had acquired by his large
fortune. Longinus was recalled from
banishmcnt by Vespasian.

ib. Senecae] The well-known phi-
losopher aud dramatist, put to death
bv Nero, who had been his pupil.
His wealth was enormous‚ and no
doubt contributed to his fate. The
immediate cause, however, was a
chame of his having been conc-erned
in Piso's unsucccssful conspiracy
against Nem, ΑΛ). (55. Seneca was
allowed to open his own veins, and
his wife Paullina did the same. The
philosopher's blood flowed slowly,
and his torture was extreme. After
taking hemlock ineffectuany, he en-
tered a bath to accelerate his death,
and was finally suffocated in a va-
pour-stove. Paullina recovered.

17. Lateranorum] Plautius Latera-
nus joined in the unsuccessful con-
spiracy against Nero, ΑΛ). 65, and
was executed by that emperor's or-
der.

28-30. alter—alter] Democri-
tus is the well-known philosopher of
Abdera (horn ΒΟ. 460), and Herac-
leitus. an Ephesian philosopher, who
flourished about B.C. 513. Democri-
tus took as cheerfu] a view of human
errors as Heracleitus did the reverse.
Hence the former became proverbial
as the ‘⁸ laughing‚'¹ the latter as the
‘⁴ owing? philosopher.

former was surpn'sing. The satire of
a laugh was easy enoughz but it is
wonderful where Heracleitus could
