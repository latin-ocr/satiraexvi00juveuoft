Gurgite de Siculo : nam, dum se continet Auster,
Dum sedet et siccat madidas in carcere pennas,
Contemnunt mediam temeraria lina Charybdim.
Vos anguilla manet, longae cognata colubrae,
Aut glaeie adspersus maculis Tiberinus, et ipse

Vernnla riparum, pinguis torrente cloaca,

the poul-

legacy-hunter (‘ captator') sends in
the fish as a present, and the rich
widow sells it. See note on Sat. iv,
18-22.

104. Tiberinus] sub. “ lupus.''
“ Tiber-pike.'' Horace (Sat. ii. ⁸2.
31) gives the complete phrase.

106. Suburae] See note on Sat.
111. o.

107. Ipsi] the host.

108-113] ‘⁴ We do not expect
the presents which the great for-
merly sent. ive only ask you, when
you do give an invitation, to sup
with us on even terms (lit. citi-
zenly);—not as if we were slaves or
aliens.''

1109. Seneca] See note on Sat.
x. 6.

ib. Piso—Cotta] Probably C. Gal-

urnius Piso and L. Aurelius Cotta.
ii'he latter was praetor B.c. 70, and
a friend of Cicero. Piso was the
leader of the unsuccessful conspiracy
against Nero, ΑΛ). 65. On its de-
tection he opened his own veins‚ and
bled to death. But perhaps the names
are used at random for any of the
illustrious families.

110, 111⁴] ‘⁵ For formerly the re-
nown of munificence was deemed

Anseris ante ipsum magni jecur, anseribus par

greater than birth or office?

llO. titulis] The inscriptions on
the ⁸ imagines ' of ancestors. Those
who had filled a curule magistracy.
were entitled to have a figure of
themselves modelled in wax and
painted. This was termed the ‘jus
iinaginum;'and the possession of
these 'imagines' by their families
distinguished the ‘ nobiles ' from
the ‘novi homines.' See Sat. vi.
162, 163; viii. 1-5, and notes3 also
note on Sat. i. 100. The curule
magistracies were the offices of dic-
tator, consul, praetor, censor, and
curule aedile. They were so called,
because those who sei-ved them had
the right of sitting on the ‘ sella cu-
rulis: the ancient symbol of royalty.

ib. fascibus] The well-known in-
signia of office of the consuls, prae·
tors, and dictators3 also of the quaes·
tors when in the provinces. They
consisted of twelve bundles of rods,
each carried by a lictor. Out of
Rome, the ‘ fasces* had an axe (⁴ se·
curis') projecting from the centu-e,
and were carried before both consuls.
In the city, the axes were removed,
and only one consul had the lictors
and fasces, the other being pre-
