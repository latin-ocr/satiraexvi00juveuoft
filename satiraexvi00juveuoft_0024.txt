At Rome, as with ourselves‚ the
primary sources of law were two-
fold: legislativc enactment (⁴· lex'')‚
our “statute'' οι· “written'' law,
and immemorial custom (·‘mos''),
our ‘⁵cou1m0n,'' “customaryJ' or
‘⁴ unwritten '¹ law; whether as affect-
ing the whole community‚ or par—
ticular places or persons. The
“lex'' was of course comprised in
tlte rollection of “ leges ” like our
“Acts of Pal-liament;'' while the
‘⁴ mos '' was ascertained by authori—
tative decisions either affirming or
implying it. In this sense the
tel‘ms are distinguished by Horace,
‘⁸ Mos et lex maculosum edomuit
nefas.” od. iv. 5, 22. Α

Besid es these two sources, however,
there will necessarily be a third, viz,
the development of the general
principles, both of ‘⁸ lex'' and
“ mOS,'' by their application, in the
coursev of litigation, to the features
of particular cases : thus, practically,
evolving from day to day, a body of
new law. With us, this is the ex-
clusive province of the Law Courts,
whose decisions, until reversed, are
of binding authority in all similar
cases. At Rome, as on the Con-
tinent now, the decisions of the
Coutts had not this force; but on

the other hand, the greatest weight
was attached to the opinions of
‘juris consulti? which came to the
same thing.

Combining the above remarks, it
will be seen that what the law in
fact was on any given point, would
be asem-minem partly from the
written ‘’leges,'' (with which may
be classed “ senatus consulta,” and
praetors' edicts,) and partly from
these authoritative expositions as
well of the “mos ” itself as of the
developments in detail both of the
‘⁴ mos'' and “lex.'‘ The entire
body of law thus ascertained was
“jus,'' or “jus civile.'' ¹ Leges' and
‘jura' were its subdivisions, the
former compi-ising what was ascer—
tained from the written law; the
latter, what was ascertained from the
other sources above referred to. (It
should be observed, that ‘jura’¹
melans also the several provisions of
a ‘ ex.'
