199. Ventidius] P. Ventidius 13:15-
sns. He was a native of Pice-
ιιιιιιι, and taken prisoner by the Ro-
mans in the Social warg see note
on Sat. v. 31. Hence the force of
the word ⁸·‹·aptivis'' in l. 201. Vcn-
tidius, wlm was still a youth, was
biouglitto Rome, and for some years
ean-ned a livelihood as mule-driven:
See Virgil's p-rody on Catullus,
“ Sabinus ille. quem videtis, hospi·
tis,’' «c. (Catalcct. 8. n. Hvynv.) He
uas afterwards taken up by Cacsar,
and evcntnally roz—e to be consul,
B C. 43. After this he was employed
as Antony's legate against the. l’ar-
thians, and triumphe-d Bc. 38: h‹=nce

became proverbial.

204, 2‹›5. Secundi Carrina‘is] A
rhetoricum in Caligula’s reign, who
banished him for the sreedou] of his
declamatione.

205. Ῐιιιηο] This must be Carri—
nas. or some other recent toacher uf
rhetoric, whose story was familiar.
'IJhere is no account, indeed, of Car-
l'lnas having retii-ed to Athens and
taken poison, but this is hardly an
objection. It seems impossible that
Socrates himself (see next note)
should be the ‘⁴ hunc inopi—1115* nn-
less we adopt the suggestion that a
line has dropped ont before this.

206. nil praeter—cicutas] i. e. no
better entertaininent than yon gave
Socrates. 'she death of Socrates is
detailed in Plato's Phaedo. As is
well known. he was compelled to
drink henilock :—“ magistrum—sor-
bitio tollit quein dira eientae,” Pers.
Sat. iv. l. 23. Socrates, like Carri-
nas, was a σοφιστήςῑ see l. 107 and
note.

the rhetoric teacher; the insolence
of his pupils.
