wife. She was entitled to a return
of this in full. where the divorce was
not the result of her own misconduct.
Herethe sreedman (whose presence as
a witness was required by the ⁸ Lex
Julia’) insolently words it as ⁴‘ collige
sarcinulas,'‘ ·‘ pack up your trapS.”

147. et saepe emaum] “ And you
do use your handkerchief rather
often.''

148. sicco—naso] “ Some one
who has not a standing catarrh.''

149. Interea] While her beauty
lasts.

ib. calet] “is hot upon it·‚'' i. e.
lobks alive for her own interest.

150] “Apulian sheep-walks, and
Falernianvineyards.” The Apulian
wool was famous. See Sat. ix. 55.
Canusium was a town of Apulia.

151. pueros-tota] “ every slave
he has, his whole farm—labourers.”
The ‘ergastulum' was a private con-
(“ carcer rusticus,” Sat.
xiv, 24) for runaway or incorrigible
slaves, who worked in the fields in
chains. Cf. Sat. viii. 180 ; also Hor.
Sat. ii. 7. 118, “ accedes opera agro
nona Sabino.''

153, 154. Mense-nautis] i. e. at
the feast of the Saturnalia„ which
was held in the “winter month‚''
December. It was holiday-time;
and booths were erected in public
places sor the sale of small toys for
presents. These were called · sigilla '
(dimin. from ‘ signa '); and the two

last days of the festival were called
‘Sigillaria' from them. One favourite
site for these booths was the ‘porticus
Argonautarum: It was eres-ted hy
Agrippa, and adorned with fi-escoes
representing the exploits of Jason
and his fellow-voyagers. While the
booths were up, these frescoes were
concealed ;—· mercator Jason ' was
shut up (clausus). and the white
booth blocked out his crew.

The above is the Scholiast's state-
ment. Itis probably an entire myth ς
but that is his concern. The alterna-
tive of taking “casa candidff for the
snow-whitened cot of winter would
be pitiable,

155. tollantur] ‘⁴ must be pur-
chased for her.n Lit. “taken ‹›ff.''
These purchases are of course not
made at the humble booths of the
*si-gilla? but at the regmlar shops.
She has her own costly veision of
the festival.

156-158.] It is difficult to ex-
plain why one particular gem should
be referred to here. Perhaps this
diamond of Beroniee's had been for
sale at the time.

158. sorori] i. e. to Beronice.
This was the Agrippa before whom
St. Paul made his defence‚ Acts xxm
xxvi. He was the son of the Agrippa
who put St. James to death, and irn-
