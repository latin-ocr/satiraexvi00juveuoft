fatted hen.

116. raduntur] “are peeled.'' See
Sat. xiV. 7, and note there.

116, 117.] Mushrooms require
moisture.

120. Structorem] The arranger of
the dishes on table. The term also
seems, from 1. iel-124, to include
the “carptor,'' or carver, as in Sat.
xi. 136-141, In Sat. ix. 110, the
latter (and correct) name is used.

121. χειρονομοῦντα] Consu-ue as
participle.

122. dictata] subst. plur. : “
sons.''

125-127.] “ As to conversing,
you had best not attempt it.''

125. ictus—Cacus] The story is
well known from Virg. Aen. viii. 190

127. tamquam habeas tria nomina]
i.e. “as if you were of noble de-
scent.'' A Roman who was not well-
bom had only two names, his own
and that of his family 3—0ur Chris-

A

les-

· tian and eui-name, in fact. Persons

of good birth had a. third name, in-
dicating the ⁶ gens,q or ancient house
to which the family belonged. This
additional name ended usually in
‘ iuss and was, practically, a title of
nobility.

W'here there were three names,
they were distinguished respectively
as the ίργειιθῐιοιιιοῃ,θ ‘nomem' and
‘cognomen' The ‘ praenomen'
stood first, and indicated the indi-
vidua] ς as ⁸ Marcus? The ‘ nonien‚'
or title of the ‘gens‚' stood second3
as ‘Tullius' The ‘cognomen‚' or
sumame, was placed last; as ⁴ Cicero.’

In addition to these three names,
there was occasionally a fourth, de·
rived from some personal merit or
other quality. It was called the
‘agnomeu,' and followed the ‘cog-
nomen3' as ‘ Africanus? Occa-
sionally, these ‘agnomina' de-
scended like the ‘ cognomen ; ' thus,
both sons of Scipio were ‘ Africani?

127-129] “When does Virro
ever taste the cup, and hand it to
you ?'' This was an usual com-
pliment to a guest, both at Greek
and Roman entertainments. ‘ Su-
mitque—pocula : ' ‘⁴ or take it from
you in turn ?'' ‘Propinare' is Latin-
ized from προπίνειν.
