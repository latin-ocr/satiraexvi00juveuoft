4. Praetoris—urnam] The “ju—
dices'' appointed by the Praetor to
try a cause (see on Sat. iii. 213)

urn. lf either of the litigants had
interest with the Praetor (“ gratia '')
he could favour them by tampering
with the lots, so as to ensure their
having such judges as they would

prefer. Hence here ‘⁴ fallacem Prae-
toris u1·nam.''
